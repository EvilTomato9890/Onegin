A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
A Russian household simple quite,
A Russian in Childe Haroldâ€™s cloak,
A Russian poemâ€™s mechanism
A Vampire fond of meditation,
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
A ball here, there a childrenâ€™s treat,
A ball in Peterâ€™s capital,
Abandon cities riotous,
Abandoned he his country seat,
â€œAbandon hope for ever here!â€
Abandoning insane delight,
A bastard fame prohibited?
A bastard fame prohibited?
A bearded postillion astride
A beau is for Tattiana found!
A beauty languidly at rest,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
A book at early morn perused.
A bottle of a vintage white
About the crop of hay, the wine,
About the rain and flax and cattle.â€â€”
Above the ashes of the dead.
Above the humble urn of death.
Above the yawning grave would fight,â€”
A box of terrible import.
A breathless silence then, prolongedâ€”
A breathless silence then, prolongedâ€”
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
Absorbed in melancholy mood
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
A canine face with horns thereon,
A careless looker-on estranged
A case of books he doth obtainâ€”
Accelerates her hasty pace,
Accents of rapture or despair
A certain little escapade
A charm with it in conversation.
A child devoid of childishness
A constant harping on one tune,
A coquette loves by calculation,
A countenance perplexed and scared.
A country damselâ€™s album trim,
Acquaintance instantly to make.
A crab upon a spider rides,
A critic of the stage malicious,
Across her youth a shade had come,
Across the Balticâ€™s salt sea waves,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
Across the smiling face of dawn.
Across the stage still madly sweep,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
A curious interest disclose
A dagger, asterisk, or note
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
Adieu she to the matron said
â€œAdieu! thou home where peace abides,
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
Adieu! whateâ€™er thou didst desire
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A door he opens. But why shrank
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Adorned with many a vision bright
A double force unto their song
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
Adroitly seized and carried her;
A duellist of classic mind,
A due which must to earth be paid.
â€œAdvance!â€â€” Indifferent and sedate,
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
A dying man with art to soothe,
A faithful model she appeared
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
A feeble version read below,
A few of different temper deemed,
_Affectionately yours till death_.
Affection how did you requite?
Affection how did you requite?
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
A finished madrigal would frame
A first success light pinions gave,
A flimsy trace of musings past
A fop, in dress pedantical.
A forest now she sees in front
A fragile bridge and insecure,
A friar black approaching near,
A friendly hand thy life hath taâ€™en!
After the wedded couple strain;
Again a century should scourge
Again her rural life she sought,
Again imagination blazed,
Again in her ethereal dance?
Against my inclination, friends,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
Again the plague of boyhoodâ€”love?
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A game of chess would often play,
A garden by a shining rill.
Age immature averse to cheatâ€”
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
A gust of passion never tore
Ah! Iâ€™m so weakâ€”my throbbing breast!
Ah! I still struggle to forget
A hand of ice appeared to seize
A happy destiny ordained:
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
â€œAh! come, Tattiana, come to me!
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
A hermitâ€™s life OnÃ©guine led,
Ah! he has gone the other wayâ€â€”
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
A hidden meaning could impart,
A hidden train of wild desire.
Ah! it may be, affection true
â€œAh! long the world hath missed thy shape!
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
â€œAh! nurse, a favour do for me!â€â€”
A horseâ€™s hoofs she hearsâ€”She shrinks!
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
A hundred times will not repeat,
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
A jolly song and distant horn;
A joyous troop of little boys
A kerchief round her silver hair
Akulka who was once Celine,
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
â€œAlack! Tattiana,â€ she replied,
A lady draws the hostess near,
A ladyâ€™s hand doth never kiss.
A lancer captivates her heart!
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Alarm the winter journey gave.
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
â€œAlas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
Alas! for now before her passed
Alas! he loved as in our times
Alas! how wretched now my lot!â€
Alas! lifeâ€™s hours which swiftly fly
â€œAlas! my friend, no revenue!â€
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
Alas! my stomach it betrays
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Alas! the friend of childish days
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
Albums magnificent which scare
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
A letter for her hero meant:
A life in common with the rest;
A life of fact, not fiction, ledâ€”
Alike by sighs and flattery.
A little Juvenal to spout,
A little farther please to read
A little virgin mirror peeps.
All Nature winter seemed to await,
All about Olgaâ€”to a light
All are amazed; but Lenski he
All are constrained and fetters bear,
All arise. To the door he goes.
All breathless and without replies.
All bustle when he makes a sign:
All covered up with snow in heaps,
All dark and silent hath become;
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
All in the good old style appears,
All mothers their sweet girls believed
All overtures of friendship ended.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
All silently hung down his head.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
All so distinct, and all so white!
All sons of mental weariness.
All that a poet could desire,
All that industrial London brings
All that perfection could desire;
All the creations which below
All the young people round about,
All this I know is out of date,
All this in many cases brings
All this, my friends, translate aright:
All this was novel to Eugene.
All to the doctors Eugene send,
All to the grand saloon are goneâ€”
All vanished as an echo goes.
All visited him at first, of course;
All which caprice and affluence craves,
All which in Paris eager taste,
All with urbanity betray,
Almost became a poet sayâ€”
A loaded pistol in his hand.
A load of care upon the maid.
Alone amid possessions great,
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Alone within his habitation
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Along Saint Petersburgâ€™s paved streets,
Along the Nevaâ€™s bank he sleighs,
Along the hall, and high above
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
A loverâ€™s letter might convey,
A love which knew no limitation,
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
Already by repentance moved
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Already dance to song proceeds;
Already he grew phthisical.
Already sings the nightingale.
Also one ViÃ¡zemski, remarking
Also their feetâ€”yet neâ€™ertheless
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
Also, to equalise the scales,
Although her book did not contain
Although it will not bear translation,
Although the destined coffin nears,
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
Although we know that Eugene had
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Always together, eventide
Am I to go through the whole list?â€
A maidenâ€™s secretsâ€”of the heart.
A maid hath oft, may yet again
A mansionâ€”by the window, see!
A marriageable maid matured,
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
Amid a serious disputation,
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Amid sly, pusillanimous
Amidst successes flattering
Amid submissive herds of men
Amid the awful emptiness
Amid the company career.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Amid the soulless sons of pride
A mien unaltered she preserved,
A mild quotation to translate,
A million bipeds reckons thus
A modern Regulus unchained,
A moment effervescing stirs,
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
An almanac but eight years old.
An ancient lady full of grace.â€”
An ardent heart and yet so mild?â€”
And â€œAgathonâ€ replied, amazed.
And Christian folk will, I expect,
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
And Eugene ever in her soul
And Eugene soon discovered there
And FliÃ noff, pensioned councillor,
And FliÃ noff, somewhat indisposed,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
And I admired their common sense
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
And I confess that now-a-days
And I discerned through Fancyâ€™s prism
And I, remembering Svetlana,
And I to give thee cakes was wont?â€â€”
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
And Lenski followedâ€”a light brokeâ€”
And Limburg cheese alive and old
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
And Schiller read by candlelight.
And Taniaâ€™s husband soon appeared.â€”
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
And about dawn upon his breast
And a boy handed round the cream.
And a determined disposition,
And after Albionâ€™s proud lyre
And after them at headlong pace
And agitate my heart again;
And a grand festival proceeds.
And a guitar produced we see,
And a half rubles down gave she;
And aimless journeys did commenceâ€”
And all in snow is buried deep.
And all that from thy hand proceedsâ€”
And all the joys which Winter knows.
And all the three to breakfast went;
And all thy precious elegies,
And all with one accord agreed,
And all without her husbandâ€™s leave.
And all your love on self bestow;
And a long time about her talked.
And alphabetically tries
And also fashionable beaux.
And also that my feeble verseâ€”
And a malicious epigram
And ancient usages observed
And an elegiac poem wrote.
And an enchanting shoulder shines
And an encouragement did breathe
And a new diadem supplied.
And an habitual sense of pain;
And an old gent the poet marking
And a romance in ancient style
And as a country damsel roved,
And at economy was great;
And at the altar of their fame
And at the stages bugs and fleas
And at the table sat her down.
And barely visible the smoke
And be as happyâ€”as I might.
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
And beckon to the passing sails.
And bends her mirror on the moon,
And be not in advance severe.
And better, if I judge aright;
And better, if I judge aright;
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
And bless mankind with full delight.
And blest me, sinking to the grave.
And blest the shadows of the night.
And blush to own himself reflect.
And boiling oâ€™er with friendly heat,
And both of dull existence tired,
And breathe a drama in his ear.
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
And brooding oâ€™er the ills he bore,
And buried deep in meditation,
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a sweet delusion he
And by degrees upon him grew
And by that shady rivulet
And by the fiddleâ€™s rushing sound
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
And, by the way, I here assert
And by the world repeated oft,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
And can it be? But late a child
And cannot anything conceal,
And care but little for its ends.
And cares not farther to proceed;
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
And clad in airy costume took
And comfort of each country dame,
And consolation soon begot.
And contemplative dreaminess;
And cool sagacious mind he had:
And courtier, fop, and usurer
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
And cry: he was a poet great!
And dames of fine organisations,
And dark and drear the evenings were,
And death before the husband wide
And deem the world perfection is!
And devastate the woods around.
And disappear in space; then she
And distance interposed in vain,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
And dost thou know her?â€â€”â€œWe live near.â€
And dream of lifeâ€™s delightful dawn?
And due precautions take betimes.
And ease and fashionable waste,â€”
And ease the tortures of the heartâ€”
And education runs to waste,
And (elbows on the table) they
And endless the cotillon seemed
And enmity and hope and loveâ€”
And every morning I awake
And every year distributed
And exclamations and good cheer.
And exclamations interlaced.
And eye which gleams with inspirationâ€”
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
And far removed from rumour vain;
And far removed from rumour vain;
And fashionable magazines,
And fashionâ€™s gay frivolities;
And female tears hysterical,
And fields my joys have ever been;
And finally he deigns let fall
And finally, upon his bed
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
And fled afarâ€”she followed me.
And flooded all the level ground.
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And following them ye might espy
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
And for a time our course delay,
And form a network left and right;
And freezing fits of weariness.
And from his dressing-room would pass
And from the Millionaya afar
And from the country all around
And from the misty woodland nigh
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
And full of innocent delight,
And gallicisms I love as well
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
And gallops to her house away.
And gave himself but little pain
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
And glasses unemployed all night;
And glittering simpletons beside;
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
And gossip of the town and fashion
And gradually day unfolds.
And grant his weary bones their rest
And grant success to labour long;
And grasp a stirrup fortunateâ€”
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
And grown more curious by far
And had with waddling in the end
And handsome countenance combined,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
And harmony was soon restored.
And hastened to his uncleâ€™s side,
And hated casual visitors,
And hates the worldâ€™s discordant ways.
And hat surnamed a â€œBolivarâ€
And heard a voice cryâ€”_Why! Heâ€™s killed!_â€”
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
â€œAnd heâ€”but of him presentlyâ€”
And heedless of approval seems,
And he had made her heart beat quick!
And her bespangled robe doth wave
And herds of oxen wandering low;
And her upon the threshold laid.
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
And his poor basten sandal knits.
And his strange conduct at the dance
And homeward like an arrow tore.
And honestly â€™tis my belief
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
And hot with jealous indignation,
And hurried home his awful freight.
And husbandsâ€™ tedious amity?
And if Tattiana mine had foundâ€”
And impiously should declare,
And in addition youth is flame
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
And in a whisper did repeat:
And in her conversation drawled.
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
And in her hand a French romance.
And in her languid bosom raise
And in her native language she
And in reality one day
And in society might shed
And in society might shed
And, inspiration firing me,
And in the Summer Garden rove.
And in the bathroom did command
And in the final tome we learnt,
And in the frosty night alone
And in the morning doth not know
And irrigate them with champagne;
And irritates the appetite.
And is all light within destroyed?
â€œAnd is it long since back he came?
â€œAnd is it,â€ meditates Eugene.
â€œAnd is it she? It must beâ€”noâ€”
And is it true and not a jest,
And is it true her garland bright
And isolated from all men,
And it may be a secret dread
And jests doth recapitulate.
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
And, joy of souls effeminate,
And judgment which unsteady veers
And kindness Tania was impressed,
And leads a solitary life?
And leaning â€™gainst the portal closed
And leans upon the monsterâ€™s arm,
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And led me off to church with song.â€
And lessons to his children read.
And life and fate in turn selected
And like Childe Harold gloomily
And like Napoleons each of us
And like a palisade flit by.
And like a shadow haunted her.
And like his shadow dogged his life,
And like the prisonerâ€™s our delight
And linen on him doth bestow.
And lo! five paces more they pass,
And lo! he is already there!
And lonely through the forest creeps.â€
And long her eyes as through a haze
And long internal agitation
And long perukes hath vanishÃ¨d.
And loveâ€™s delicious diadem
And loves you asâ€”a relative!
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
And madrigals Iâ€™m asked to write!
And make a dark existence shine
And many a caravan on high
And many a day thereafter laid
And many another slily sneered;
And marking Taniaâ€™s agitation,
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
And may fall headlong any time.
And meditative from the spot
And meditative homeward goes,
And mental elasticity.
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
And more imagination teems.
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
And my Eugene the path must traceâ€”
And my Tattiana now began
And my dark soul to light was brought;
And my romanceâ€™s open theme
And naked uniformity.
And natural benevolence,
And necessary fools allowed.
And never hath our language proud
And never was the ear affright
And no ridiculous report,
And not a speck of dirt descried.
And nothing more important sees;
And now, I mournfully confess,
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
And now he views forgotten foes,
And now his youthful heart desires
And now philanthropy his soul,
And now she skips and now she springs
And now â€™tis night, the guardian moon
And now upon the snow in thaw
And now we hear delightedly
And numerous pages had preserved
And oâ€™er the granite coping bent,
And oft at eventide a throng
And of the attic. Honestly,
And of the irksome harness tires,
And oft in whispers would impart
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
And oh! what verses, what delights,
And on the footstool sitting down
And on the last one, underlined:
And others rise ephemeral!
And ought he not to disregard
And our successors soon shall drive
And our swift troikas never tire;
And overcome antipathies
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
And past the threshold of decay,
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
And physic bring with mournful face,
And platitudes and pedantry,
And pleasureâ€™s daily blandishment,
And pressed her handâ€”the crimson blush
And privileges nice allowed,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
And reads with rapid eager eye
And rest from bygone days of strife.
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
And rising from her bench proceeds;
And roofs near morn blanched oâ€™er with snow;
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
And sallied forth one brilliant mornâ€”
And satisfied with vengeance taâ€™en.
And saying this Vladimir drained
And scanned in silence its content.
And secretly their views expound.
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
And sermonâ€”but in that dread hour
And sermonâ€”but in that dread hour
And shall adopt some new caprice.
And she at last hath us deceived;
And she despite herself would waste
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
And shorter had the days become.
And showed with an uncertain light
And shut him in a lonely nook.
And silent as the maid Svetlana
And since I pulled thee by the earâ€”
And slowly life coagulatesâ€”
And soâ€”God bless them, if He list.
And so Tattiana was her name,
And so departed. But Eugene,
And solitude and calm delight,
And solitude and calm delight.
And sometimes into snares as well
And so my noon hath come! If so,
And soon Lel hovered oâ€™er her head.
And soon OnÃ©guineâ€™s door beside
And soon imagination threw
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
And spectacles, his knitting staid
And spouted it with lyric fireâ€”
And spur my spiritâ€™s torpid mood!
And starting suddenly doth say:
And stay whose length none recollects.
And still the coachmen round the fires
And stoves of various shapes abound.
And straight returning whence he came,
And stupid censors passionate;
And such unconsciously he led,
And sulked in silent indignation;
And supercilious dames she glides,
And supper. In the country we
And swifter than the swallowâ€™s flight.
And tears of reconciliation:
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
And testy gamesters do engage
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And that no longer could inspire.
And that too often we receive
And that unrivalled paragon,
And the SkatÃ¨nines, aged pair,
And the attendants called in haste.
And the bad book accompanies.
And the cast-iron statuette
And the cold beauties of the season:
And the conviction soon arose,
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And the eternal lorgnette through
And the extent of his caprice;
And the fair sex as light as down!
And the far mountains daintily
And the heartâ€™s agitated dreams.
And the kind-hearted servitors:
And the lime alleyâ€™s twilight dim
And the lone secret of her heart,
And the more surely we ensnare
And then a cup of coffee drank,
And the newcomers welcome bade.
And then made merry pope and guest,
And then â€œmonsieurâ€ supplied her place;
And then she soon â€™twixt work and leisure
And then the stanzas of my theme
And then with blind credulity
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
And the recesses of my mind
And the sagacious Triquet back
And the saloon threw open wide;
And these the attentive maid observed
And the suspicious veteran old,
And the world met her smilingly,
And the young damsel from the town,
And the young girl appeared before
And the young ladies fortunes told,
And the young revellers of past times
And they the waters recommend.
And think: here lies who loved me well,
And this fifth canto ought to be
And this the faithful one allows,
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
And though I read it with distress,
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
And though her soul might be confused,
And though perchance a lady may
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.â€
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
And thou, persistent to the end,
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
And thou, youthâ€™s early inspiration,
And through the lofty windows views
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
And thus he never fell among
And thus he spent eight years of time,
And thus in season the rich field
And thus it is â€™twould cause me pain
And thus secures the prey we seek.
And thus unto her nurse did say:
And thy inebriating wave
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
And to OnÃ©guine far away
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
And to the field of honour led;
And to these letters and these tears.
And to these letters and these tears.
And town and friends forgotten quite.
And traces with a slender finger
And triumphs in career erotic.
And true, his pistolâ€™s faultless aim
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
And turned aside the drapery;
And turned to leave immediately,
And two old pines their branches spreadâ€”
And unto whom we all allude
And usually despised it too),
And vanish like a bird in air.
And various chords upon it proves,
And vehemently though amazed
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
And views amongst themselves advance
And visit many a foreign clime,
And vows will probably be signed:
And wakened him with the loud cry:
And watch her eyeâ€™s full glance to meet.
And well-instructed to betray!
And what from its recess appears?
And what like menaces fatigues,
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
And what she from the cards inferred.
And what the old man might bequeath.
And what will Destiny concede?â€
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
And when her violence reviewedâ€”
And when the watery mirror gleamed
And where Thalia softly dreams
And where a madrigal occurs
And where at last his bones repose
And where may be her sister now?
And wheresoeâ€™er thy footsteps err,
And where tempestuous loveâ€™s desires,
And where the admirable streams
And where the billows hoarsely raise
And who is not a tiresome thief?
And wholly occupied his dayâ€”
And who the rent-roll of his race
And wild among them grew her wordsâ€”
And wild festivities among
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
And wisely gallops to the hill.
And wished to say to him farewell.
And with emotional delight
And with gray hair ambrosial
And with his lot in life content,
And with remorseful anguish filled,
And would by candlelight arise.
And yet he in your cause would strive
And yet oblivion forbade.
And yet the cityâ€™s flower was there,
And you, O maids immaculate,
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
An ear to my confession lend;
An ever transcendental flight;
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
A new acquaintance we must scan.
A new proprietor arrived,
Anew the flames of passion start
A new world was made manifest!
An exile from their troublous reign,
An explanation: she was scared,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
An honourable course ye took,
An honourable course ye took,
An hour passed byâ€”anotherâ€”till,
Anicia soon appears, the door
An idle anchorite and sad,
An infant maiden doth exhort
An innate love of meditation,
An inn at every stage erect.
An invalid from lung complaint.
Announcing to him dinner-time.
A noted fop who gambled hard.
Another bard with art divine
Another could her heart engage,
Another could her woe assuage
Another his betrothed was given;
Another passed; â€™twas just the same.
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Another tribune of the ball
Another visit hastes to pay.
Another with cockâ€™s head appeared,
A notoriety proclaimed,
A notoriety proclaimed,
An oval countenance and pink,
A novel in Lafontaineâ€™s style,
Anticipating woe she pined,
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
A pair of bulletsâ€”nought besideâ€”
A pair; though desolate my mind,
A paragon of virtue he!
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
A pensive sorrow in her glance
A philosophic anchorite:
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
Appear; along the road of Tver
Appear attuned to softer chords;
Appeared, Donâ€™s effervescing boast,
Applause, the peopleâ€™s donative.
Approach, approach; I am thine own.â€
Approaches Olga and the pair
A print without the pictureâ€™s grace,
A promenade in twilight late
A prudent man like you and brave
Are admirable, my dear friend,
Are all your relatives quite well?
A register of fleeting thought,
Are not with elegance impressed.
Are oft deceptiveâ€”like their feet.
Are turned upon her. All combine
Are ye replaced by other maids
A riding whip. She strolls along.
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
Arising with the morningâ€™s light,
A rivulet beneath them shoots
Around her neck, now violently
Around my stanzas incomplete
Around the carriage of the pairâ€”
Around the garden homeward hies.
Around the meadow and the grove.
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
Aroused in him some tenderness.
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
Arrange without the least delayâ€”
As Saadi anciently averredâ€”
As Winter in their purity,
As a babeâ€™s slumber, or the light
As a poetic life serene,
As bees who leave their dainty store
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
A scant attendance Lenski showed
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
As cyphers others to appraise,
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
As deaf and silly doth remain,
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
A sense of social delight,
As every journal now entreats,
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
As formerly much agitation.
As formerly the shepherd sits
As giddy youthâ€™s hilarityâ€”
A shape half cat and half a crane.
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
As if against obstruction sore
As if he cruelly had joked!
As if impossible it were
As if it were some funeral feast.
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
As if with eider-down is filled.
A simple tombstone hath been set.
As in a garden when I grew,
As in a thicketâ€™s humble shade,
A single being: â€™twas in fine
As in her heart the thought sank home,
As in some frenzied dream of fear
As in their turn the seasons roll.
As in the timid forest deer,
As it were, tore himself away.
A slave of actresses capricious,
As lordly mansions ought to be,
As many dinners I rehearse,
As many entertainments be!
As men who much had done that day.
A smile from slumbering nature clear
As oft to meat and drink advert,
A something somehow have obtained,
As once, to fill the rapid page
As one who bivouacs afield,
As on the rapid wings of thought
As partner of my mournful days,
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
A sportsman who in covert lies.
As rosy lips without a smile,
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
Assemblies oligarchical
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Assistance ever will extend,
As storms which in chill autumn rage
Assuredly should not have been
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
As the reflection of his age,
As the sins of my youthful days
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
As to a worthy man and good!
A stream, by winterâ€™s ice unbound,
A strong resemblance these possessâ€”
A substitute for lamps we hail!
Asunder was and hate prepared?
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
As when the tempestâ€™s veil is drawn
As with innumerable fires.
As yet none had discovered aught;
As your light footprints on the green.
â€œAt LÃ rinaâ€™s.â€â€”â€œHem, that is queer!
At LÃ rinaâ€™s abode produced
At Russ she was by no means clever
A table to the fire is brought,
At a great feast against desire,
A tangled wilderness around.
At an old auntâ€™s they had arrived
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
At each extreme one takes his stand,
At early morn returns the maid
At eighteen not to play the fool!
A tender couplet he combined,
At eventide would hither come,
At fifty who relief obtained
At first, but soon became inured
At first for books was disinclined,
At first such contradictions wrought
At forty suffered from the gout,
A thick immense neglected grove
At his pale brow a shot to have,
At home arriving he addressed
Athwart the snow four paces cameâ€”
A timid love to banishment?â€”
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
At last became a ruined man.
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
At last my father gave his blessing,
At last the author!â€ cries Mamma.
At least by show of sympathy;
At least their accents and their words
At morn an icy bath within
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
At neighbouring hospitalities.
A tombstone, Aphroditeâ€™s shrine,
At prisonerâ€™s base she never played.
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
A true account and in detail.
At seven in summer rose from bed,
At table she was sitting by
Attend in male attire arrayed.
Attentive be unto my rhymes
Attentive listened to his speech,
Attentive listened to the lad.
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Attentive to the heartâ€™s first beating,
At the front gates, but in brief space
At the same hour she oped her eyes
At thirty who was married well,
At this time almost understood.
At times talk nonsense with design;
At times three words to him addressed
At times to silence would resort,
Attractive in its banefulness?
At twenty who was prig or swell,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
Auroraâ€™s ruddy rays of lightâ€”
Authors replete with sacred fire
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
A valuable hostage gained,
Avenge himself in proper style.
A very troublesome disease,
A victim decked with golden leaves;
A village and beneath, a wood,
A visionary mortified,
A visionary personage
A vision desolate and drear
Avowal then â€™twas time to pray,
Awaiting on the shore I roam
Await the long-delayed caress.
Awakens secret merriment
Away, Tattiana, hath been taâ€™en.
Away! and cease to ring their praise
Away her golden earrings tore;
A weary season was at handâ€”
A while ago the winter spent,
Awhile sound conversation seems
Awhile this beauty captivated,
A whisper runs along the hall,
A white and undulating pall
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
A windmill too a jig performs
A wish from place to place to roam,
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
A worthy object â€™tis, and well
Aye bids ye in some way or otherâ€”
A young Armidaâ€™s lips to press,
A young and handsome galliard.
A young man motionless he saw,
Back to his regiment must roam.
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Balconies, lionâ€™s heads on doors,
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
Bard of the â€œFeasts,â€ and mournful breast,
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Barking, young ladiesâ€™ osculations,
Basins and jugsâ€”well! everything
Bear goneâ€”she at the threshold placed;
Beats that of friends and relatives:
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
Because a member I became.
Because he could not gourmandise
Because her passion wanted art,
Because he yawned at the bare view
Because in singleness of thought
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
Because she was so innocent,
Become alarmed. So never mind!
Bedding is laid out and to all
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
Before a fire which feebly glows
Before he eighteen years attained.
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Before him her wild game of chance.
Before him red roast beef is seen
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Before such fond simplicity
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
Before the dregs they shall divine
Before whom once in solitude,
Before whose inexperienced sight
Begins to talk of this and that,
Behind her a grave general.
Behind, of glasses an array,
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
â€œBehold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrainâ€”â€
Behold! orthography despising,
Behold! than polished floor more nice
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
Behold the dames who once were fine
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Behold! the worldâ€™s opinion!
Being from hell or heaven sent,
Believed, the peopleâ€™s wisdom weird,
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
Beneath her parentsâ€™ eyes the maid
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
Beneath his lipsâ€™ devouring kiss.
Beneath his lipsâ€™ devouring kiss.
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Beneath the sheltering oak treeâ€™s shade
Beneath the silver of the moon
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
Beside a nameless rivulet,
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
Besides, a duellist well-known
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
Beside the stormy sea one day
Beside the thundering abyss
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
Better than Chateaubriand did
Between myself and my Eugene,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Between the stalls, along the toes;
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
Beyond this may attempt to write_.
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
Blest be the labours of the light,
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
Books he abandoned like the fair,
â€œBoredom, my friend, behold the illâ€”â€
Born of a babbler in a loft
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
Both day and night he now must pass
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
Both natural and truthful seemed.
Both were expectant of the hate
Both were of passion satiate
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
BouyÃ noff courted. She refused.
BouyÃ noff too, my cousin, wore
BouyÃ noff whisked off Poustiakova.
BouyÃ noff, wrathful cousin mine,
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
â€œBring dinner now without delay!â€
Bringing his partner corpulent
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Bruin is marching at her back!
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
Buried in meditation deep,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
But Eugene, hating litigation
But Eugene, incontestably,
But Eugene long hath left the press
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But Fortune cast our lots apart
But I abandoned their array,
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
But I am now anotherâ€™s brideâ€”
But I came not to adulate:
But I, in love, was mute and dull.
But I must add to what I write
But I must now employ my Muse
But I perceive thou dost not heedâ€”â€
But I the products of my Muse,
But I was sharp in times gone by.
But Iâ€”what is all this to me?
But Lenski, I should be so glad
But Lenski, having no desire
But Lenski madrigals neâ€™er wrote
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
But Olga would not such peruse.
But, O ye tomes without compare,
But Summer swiftly fades away
But Tania just as in a dream
But Tania neâ€™er displayed a passion
But Taniaâ€™s heart is not at ease,
But, after mutual compliments,
But ah! discerns nor wood nor meadâ€”
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
But, as he never opened them,
But as to fightingâ€”â€™twill appear!
But at a later, sterile age,
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
But better loved the soft repose
But borne in spirit far away
But by degrees the crowd begin
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
But cannot anyhow evade
But cannot stand the northern cold.
But competition I abjure
But contrary to her advice
But could not. Then she questioned him:â€”
â€œBut,â€ cried Zaretski in amaze,
â€œBut death from him will be delight.
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
But enough! Now, â€™tis my intent
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
But even thus not now-a-days!
But fashionable hatredâ€™s flame
But finally grew bored by her.
But finally he oped his eyes
But finally in wedlock bind.
But finally she heaves a sigh,
But finally she softly said:
But finally she softly said:
But first permission did request
But followed the strict rules of art,
But foolsâ€”their calumnies and sneersâ€â€”
But from the Musesâ€™ loftiest height
But from the interview what flowed?
But gazes on OnÃ©guineâ€™s face
But gazes on OnÃ©guineâ€™s face
But grant with magnanimity
But gray Phillippevna the door
But grown familiar side by side
But he desired not to beguile
But, her own room in memory,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
But home his body to despatch
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
But, howsoeâ€™er his lot were cast,
But if the truth I must relate,
But in his heart dissatisfied,
But in the drawing-room all appeared
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
But it grew late; he must not stay;
But kindness from his eye had beamed
But lights incendiary flames
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
But lo! already the moonâ€™s light
â€œBut lo! forth from the valleys dun
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
But look youâ€”ah! do not refuse.â€
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
But man of sense and probity.
But memory like a serpentâ€™s tooth
But merely to exasperate;
But more the passions occupy
â€œBut, _mÃ¡tushka_, to Moscow you
But my OnÃ©guine the whole eve
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
But my Tattianaâ€™s eyes were dry.
But no reply unto her made.
But not at present, though sincerely
But nothing changed in them is seen,
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
But now all doubt was set aside,
But now a question in this wise
But nowhere can she find repose,
But now in her effulgence pale
But now my mind is desolate,
But nowâ€”my very blood congeals,
But nowâ€”my very blood congeals,
But nowâ€”none heeds the monument
But now our hero we must leave
But now our minds are mystified
But now ridiculous a bit.
But nowâ€”what brings you to my feet?â€”
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
But of this love, eâ€™en casually,
But once more pensive and distressed
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
But one thought only filled his mind,
But on the third of grove and mead
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
But praised be God! in health art thou!
But presently she tried to read;
But proudly in his song preserved
But round the hostess scintillate
But sad is the reflection made,
But say he was a genius who
But scarce had maids their saucers taâ€™en
But scarce had sleepâ€™s soft witchery
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
But send your grandson before long.â€
But shall depict the touching scene
But she, her sister never heeding,
But since to the backdoor they led
But sits in bed with air depressed,
But somehow there shone in his look
But soon she altered all her ways,
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
But stares into the darkness deep.
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
But still more stupid did appear
But still remembrance to him clings,
But stop! I will present thee, if
â€œBut strange am I to happiness;
But strength of mind and self-restraint
But such is not my project now,
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
But suddenly all changed around!
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
But sweeter in a midnight dream
But sweeter still it is to arrange
â€œBut tell me, nurse, can you relate
But tell me what am I to do?
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
But that Princess Pauline of old,
But that the eyes of every one
But the dark sepulchre I may
But the date subsequently changed
But the indifferent princess,
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
But the young unpolluted heart
But this adventureâ€™s consequence
But this a heinous crime appeared
But this amusement delicate
But this is my advice, â€™twere best
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
But thoughts meander far awayâ€”
But time flies and she doth forget
But to OnÃ©guine! _A propos!_
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
But, to his uncleâ€™s mansion flown,
But to the garden once again
But trembles, words he cannot find,
But trembling on the mirror dark
But tremor still her frame possessed,
But trusted the ideal she wrought?â€”
But turning morning into night,
But turn we once more to our dame.
But ultimately doth approach.
But upon all that Eugene knew
But was our friend Eugene content,
But were it not immoral I
But what a nuisance it will be,
But what astonished do I find
But what results? His eyes peruse
But, when OnÃ©guineâ€™s turn came round,
But when Tattianaâ€™s hand had taâ€™en
But when the winter season came
But when two minutes she had sat,
But where Melpomene doth rave
But wherefore not?â€”â€™Tis pleasant, nice,
â€œBut which, my dear?â€”In days of yore
But who abandon itâ€”as I
But who abandon itâ€”as I
But who in that choice company
But why are your cheeks whitening?â€
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
But will not modify a tittleâ€”
But with austerity!â€”for you
But with austerity!â€”for you
But with confused and bashful air,
But with her elder sister I
But word for word his letter read.
But would not look at Cicero.
But wretched who anticipates,
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
But you must both be quite tired out!
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
By Olgaâ€™s hand distributed
By Olga stood, dejected quite
By Providenceâ€™s dark decree!
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
By Tolstoyâ€™s pencil marvellous,
By absence who hath chilled his love,
By an avowal just as plain.
By an _obrokâ€™s_ indulgent rate:
By a rich pie were occupiedâ€”
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
By bee and butterfly which pass.
By â€œbelle Tattianaâ€ to replace.
By children and by faithful wife
By computation) it is like
By daily life deteriorated,
By dull insensibility,
By every proper-minded wife,
By flattery and loverâ€™s artâ€”
By fond illusions once possest
By fond illusions once possest
By friendship how they were abused,
By his embarrassed dignityâ€”
By indolence and languor fired
By liberties or loose or light.
By loveâ€™s inevitable flame.
By many a lamp illuminate,
By melancholy fogs concealed.
By neighbouring families bewept,
By night prepared for sorcery,
By other thoughts be occupied.
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
By rank as settled by the State.
By recklessness amuse or shame
Byronâ€™s capricious phantasy
By such allusions scandalous,
By sympathy I have been driven.
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
By the fine silver of the north.
By their own horses, not the postâ€”
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
By the sick ladyâ€™s gaiety
By visions who was neâ€™er deranged
By waters shining tranquilly,
By what idea or observation
By whom the youthful bard was slain?â€â€”
Calling to mind your icy look
Calling to mind your icy look
Callous to all he seemed to be.
Callous to all on earth becomeâ€”
Calm and without embarrassment,
Calmly her eyes encounter hisâ€”
Calmly her eyes encounter hisâ€”
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
â€œCan I inspect the mansion, please?â€
Can count the time without much fussâ€”
Cannot they amicably smile
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
Can she have been a moment gone
Canto the First of this romance.
Can we not stealthily make out
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fÃªtes;
Careless of every social rule,
Careless of fame his spirit high
Caricatures he now designed
Carried a truth divine away;
Carried away by ecstasy,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
Caught him and by the collar took
Ceased for a space all chattering.
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Certainly not Eugene alone
Certain misfortune near opined.
Chained to his bedside night and day
Change of position had essayed,
Charming is your sincerity,
Charming with grave simplicity.
Charms more enduring in the end.
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
China and bronze the tables weight,
Choosing a profitable trade,

Cocked hat and melancholy brow.

â€œCommand me, darling, what you chooseâ€â€”
Commence a new career in life
Companion of my childhoodâ€™s days.
Compassion now or wrath inspires
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
Confessions which a trusting heart
Confront thy fated torturer!
Congratulations, toasts resound,
Conquer by passion and address,
Conscious of death approximate,
Consisting of harmonious lays,
Constant affection intertwined
Contemplate her sad reverie.
Contemplativeness, her delight,
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
Contented and with victuals stored,
Conventionalityâ€™s dull toolâ€”
Corneilleâ€™s majestic genius,
Corset and album and Pauline,
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Could in romantic mantle drape
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
Could not eclipse her neighbourâ€™s light.
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
Cousin, remembâ€™rest Grandison?â€
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
Crush and confusion in the hall,
Crushing and a confusing noise;
Cunning already to display
Cursing his own stupidity,
Curtly announcing for the fray
Customs by ages sanctified,
Custom the despot soon prevails.
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Dared calmly cleanse his nails â€™fore him,
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
Dark shadows thickenâ€”a dread cry
Dark, unavailing reverie,
Dark was the valley and the wood
Debate commanded ample foodâ€”
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
Deep in our mother Earthâ€™s chill breast!â€
Deep in the distant province rude,
Deep in the greenwood far away?
Deep into debt his father ran;
Deliberate approach of guests
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
â€œDelighted.â€â€”â€œWhen?â€â€”â€œThis very night.
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
Delighted glances in return;
Delighted much his former ways
Demands that I translate for you
_Demetrius Larine, sinful man,

Desirous to annihilate

Did seem to greet the youthful year;
Did they not all the Russian tongue

Displayed a noble rectitudeâ€”
Distinctly not its mechanism.

Divinity without access
Do agitate his late repose.
Do all things which to mirth incline.
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
Do me a favour and appear.
Domestic life attracts me still,
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
Do not excuse yourself. I read
â€œDo notâ€”you mightâ€”suspicious be;
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
Doth in us or our names appear
Doth loveâ€™s incautiousness in her
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
Do we alone our losses mourn
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Drank to her health in the first place,
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall goâ€”
Dreading the worldâ€™s remarks malign,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
Dreaming herself the heroine
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
Dreams with no continuity,
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
Dressed like a London dandy he
Dressing as quickly as he can,
â€œDrive on!â€ the cheerful cry goes forth,
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
Each gave Tattianaâ€™s arm a nudge
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Each other as the shore we climb!
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
Economy political,
Eâ€™en as the poet says he leant.
Eâ€™en as the presence of a snake,
Eâ€™en for an instant find delight,
Eâ€™en from her cradleâ€™s earliest dream,
Eâ€™en hopeless egoismâ€™s dark shape.

Eight times the heroes of the fight

Either with him or thee in song,
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,â€”

Enamoured at her feet to fall.
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
Enchanted by the moonâ€™s pale beam.
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.

Endless conjectures all propound
Endowing us from out her store

Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
Entrusted all to her sincerely,

Ere conversation could begin,
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Ere the bright messenger had set.
Ere this but one brief moment beat

Esteemed him much as the world goes.

Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
Eugene, more tolerant than this
Eugene of course related nought,
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
Eugene would speak regarding these.
Euphonious, though I know a spice
Even amusing fools we miss
Even as Moscow, city proud.
Even as the love of children dear.
Even beneath her parentsâ€™ roof
Even so! His passions soon abated,
Even the rosy wafer dries
Eventually petrify
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
Ever receive with kindly hearts
Ever to hear the same replies
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Examined, mended, newly found
Examine her from head to foot.
Exceptionless as no rule is,
Except one by the window placed
Exclaiming, â€œWe must change â€™em all!
Excruciate the heart and late
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
Existence calmly sped along,
Existence without wife or friends,
Existence would not make a curse,
Existâ€”that their immortal band
Extendedâ€”haunt which Dryads love.
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
Extinguished ashes do not blazeâ€”
Faces which we meet everywhere
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Fair source of every fine idea,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Familiar to him long ago.
Fantastic images shall swarm
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
Far from his Italyâ€”his own.
Far from the rest the pair would creep
Farther Tattianaâ€™s walks extendâ€”
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
Fashion is there immutable,
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Feeling in others much esteemed.
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
Feelings which long had ceased to be
Felled a calumniator base!
Finally tost his arms in air
First reconciled and then content;
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
Flew to collect his rural tax;
Flies past the porter to the stair,
Fly frequent to my solitude,
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Follow up loveâ€”a secret meeting
Fond declarations they invite
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
For Godâ€™s sake, Lenski, donâ€™t begin!
For I myself was thirteen quite;
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
For Moscow fops and Circes each
For a fictitious misanthrope,
For a protracted space of time.
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
For consecrate to me he fell
For dolls, eâ€™en from her earliest years,
For empty sound the rascal swore he
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
For ever faithful will abide.â€
For evermore had disappeared.
For evermore is separate.
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
For every loyal Russian breast!
For ever your Tattiana leave.
For first â€œmadameâ€ his wants observed,
For follyâ€™s dues thou hadst to pay.
For, from the outset, â€™twas unjust
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
For him an honourable grave,
For him were but of little worth,
For journalistic deglutition
For law I _far niente_ take
For longâ€”for ever. To be sure
For long he had endured them all.
For maidenâ€™s hearing deemed unfit),
For my wild garden and bookcase,â€”
For oâ€™er a word to fashion known,
For on their brows I trembling read
For otherwiseâ€”God only knows!
For our Automedons are fire
For our amusement ever made
For patience, reader, I must plead!
For promises her feet reveal
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
For rural solitude and dreams,
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
For shame lift up the modest maid.
For summer to the country flown,
For tallow, wood and other things
For the first time the hammer clicks.
For the impatient chief instead.
For there he left a mournful trace.
For the young poet they display.
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,
For treachery had done its worst;
Fortune the poet had repaid.
For twice you came to them and yet
For two whole days it seemed a change
For us, may be for many a year.
For visions of my childish years
For visions of my childish years
For was it not her duty to
For which no springtime shall appear?
(For which our praise he hath deserved).
For which the poet agonized
For who imposture can endure,
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
For your instruction here to tell
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Found the ideal of my youth,
Found them in darkness side by side,
Four deadly paces do they span;
Fragments of northern poetry,
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Fresh aspirations I have known,
Fresh cause of quarrel then Iâ€™ll find,
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
Friends of the sons of every land,
From Gottingen inspired he came,
From Romulus unto our day.
From apprehension of the cost,
From boxes or from stalls in rows.
From careless stanzas such as these,
From first to last page to the rim.
From gales a hill behind was seen;
From habit or maliciously,
From hall to yard and garden flies,
From happy inspiration flow,
From hence engrossed in thought profound
From her half-open vest of night.
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
From mere vacuity of mind
From public and from private ties,
From shades of the relentless past.
From storms protection having sought,
From such digressions wholly free.
From the dread pistol turn away.
From the moist cork the bottle freed
From whose analysis minute
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
Full many a lovely star hath night
Full of exasperating thought.
Funeral amateurs abound!
Furious he from the table rose;
Gallop, mazurka, waltzingâ€”see!
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
Gazing into his face, she said:
Gazing on Lenskiâ€™s corse did standâ€”
Gazing upon a note below.
Gazing upon a note below.
Gently for pranks he would reprove
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
Girls in anticipation skip!
Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.
Give me just half a glass of wineâ€”
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
Gliding in negligent career,
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Glittered in a perspective long,
Glory with which our history teems
Goddess of loversâ€™ tender sighs.
God grant I meet not at a ball
God grant that all who herein glance,
God knows! The very trace is lost.
God save his soul eternally
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
â€œGood-bye, OnÃ©guine, I must go.â€â€”
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
Good-night.â€ Behold! she is alone!
Go, on the Nevaâ€™s bank appear,
Grant that I err not on the road.â€
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Gravely repeating to another
Great sacrifices for his sake!
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
Guards fondly hopeâ€™s uncertain dream.
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
Gvozdine, BouyÃ noff, PÃ©tÃ²ushkoff
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Habit alleviates the grief
Habit was given us in distress
Habit would bring indifference.
Had a deluded victim been
Had bid her sigh for without hopeâ€”
Had come both friends and enemiesâ€”
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
Had finished life amid his sons,
â€œHad he been long here, and where from?
Had killed me had the like been told.â€
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
Had much to do at home that day,
Had not yet withered his young breast.
Had perished a creative mind,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Had rendered him an invalid;
Had run across her path at speed,
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
Handbook of fashionable phrase
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
Happy and glorious_. But this brings
Happy he who in youth was young,
Happy who quit lifeâ€™s banquet seat
Happy who thereto can unite
Happy who timely grew mature,
Hard by the window took her place.â€â€”
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Hateful the hollow world became,
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
Hath whiled the roadâ€™s monotony,
Haughty appear, subservient,
Have echoed to eternity.
Have eâ€™er a precious tress consigned,
Have entered never to return.
Have felt loveâ€™s agitated kiss
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
Have latterly vexatious grown;
Have my OnÃ©guineâ€”suddenly.
Have my OnÃ©guineâ€”suddenly.
Have one by one all withered grown
Have shone as one of fashionâ€™s leaders.
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Having abjured the haunts of men,
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Having for moneyâ€™s sake alone
Having lost all in life we prize.
Having once fixed your interest,
Having performed his service truly,
Having remarked Vladimirâ€™s flight,
Having this mournful document
He â€œBenedettaâ€ used to hum,
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
Heard he the truth? And thus she couldâ€”
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Hears not my importunity!
Heart would not throb albeit in jestâ€”
Heaved an involuntary sigh
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
He back as from a sudden blow?â€”
He bending whispered in her ear
He bends his course to Talonâ€™s, where
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
He brought from mystic Germany
He called to mind Tattianaâ€™s grace,
He called upon me Christmas Eveâ€”
He _cannot_ give me happiness.â€
He cared no longer there to stay,
He conversation would have ledâ€”
He could in disputation shine
He daily in his drives drew near
He deemed his coming would inspire
He deemed his friends but longed to make
He deemed of human life the goal
He dragged her by a forest road
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
He drops his pistol silently.
Heedless of your despairing cry?
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
He enters. High the cork arose
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
He enters: rapidly discussion
He enters the saloon. â€™Tis blank!
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He eyed her with a fond concern,
He feared the criminal might try
He felt the laudable desire
He finally lost all delight
He fixedly upon her staresâ€”
He found him on the table laid,
He found them in an almanac,
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
He gazed upon the clock which showed
He had excepted from the ban:
He has returned, say in what guise?
He hath acquired the worldâ€™s esteem
â€œHe hath neglected us of late.â€â€”
He heard his soulâ€™s complaint within,
He hies unto the â€œBoulevard,â€
He in imagination saw
He in the early years of life
He is a charming youth and wise.
He is not there: I am not known:
He kindled his poetic flame.
He knew not how to spend his life.
He knits his browsâ€”â€™tis silent all.
He knows Kaverine will repair.
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
He left _you_ first, and I must own
He leisurely adorns for her.
He lies, upon his forehead death,
He long should have been on the road.
He loved the simpleton to mock,
He marmot-like did hibernate,
He might his motives have narrated,
He mused: â€œI will her saviour be!
He nears a spacious mansionâ€™s gate,
He neâ€™er shall hear Timeâ€™s eulogy,
He now a full possession takes,
He obstinately will remain,
He offers her his murderous paw;
He oft upon his lips would curb,
He on his bosom gently placed
He on the conflagration frowned.
He ought to have conciliated
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
â€œHe promised here this day to ride,â€
He quits the fashionable throng
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
Her Moscow cousin, often told
He racked his brains to find its clue
Her agitation and distress
Her all in all did constitute;
Her amorous experience
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
Her brow she did not eâ€™en contract
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Herds low, and under nightâ€™s dark veil
Here I remark all poets are
He read as vainly as before,
He reads at random, reads in vain.
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
Here bottles stand in close array,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
â€œHere, he resides with Simeon.
Herein my portrait should detect,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
Her features no grimaces bleared;
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Her figure perfect grows with time!
Her foot was in my other hand.
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
Her glance how wild yet genial!
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
Her handkerchief she loses now;
Her head upon her breast declines
Her health, lifeâ€™s sweetness and its bloom,
Her heart how full of gentleness,
Her heart importunately turns.
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
He rings in haste; in haste arrives
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her manners were deliberate,
Her money counted, and designed
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
He roars, and â€œAh!â€ Tattiana cries.
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
He round the billiard-table stalked,
Her passionâ€™s faithful counterpart,
Her path across the plain doth keepâ€”
Her promptings unto law did make,
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
Herself not knowing well the reason,
Her sentimental verses all,
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
Her shoulderâ€”Olga swiftly cameâ€”
Her shoulders, breast and face to laveâ€”
Her sisterhood delights the young
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
Her toiletteâ€™s antiquated style,
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
Her utterances ever heard,
Her weary eyes are filled with tearsâ€”
Her with a smile old women greet,
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
Heâ€™s a freemason, so we think.
He salutary rules poured forth?
He sang of lifeâ€™s fresh colours stained
He sang of loveâ€”to love a slave.
He sang of separation grim,
Heâ€™s a straightforward little chap.â€
He sat, and then the livelong day,
He seemed for matrimony born.
He shunned those parties boisterous;
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
He somewhat blushing would omit:
He still made love in a queer way;
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
He there is masterâ€”that is plain;
He thought so, and existence charmed.
He thought to write, but labour long
He took no more the slightest heed;
He took the room wherein the old
He to the festival repairs,
He used to hateâ€”and was no foolâ€”
He usually was glad to see
He wakesâ€”they with a letter comeâ€”
He wanders in his indolence;
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
He was a dear delightful foolâ€”
He was an honest gentleman,
He was beloved: or say at least,
He was deceived. Just as before
He was in error; for Eugene
He was most gay. The happy date
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
He was no more! The youthful bard
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
He went notâ€”sooner was prepared
He who economy abhorred,
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
He who lifeâ€™s frosts which early wrung
He whom we sing to shall be made
He will delight you, I am sure,
He with an innocence extreme
He with his little maiden played,
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
He would not that a man ye slay
He writes upon his parentsâ€™ tomb,
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
He wrote (â€™tis the romantic style,
He yawns, averts his countenance,
Hid in the gondolaâ€™s dark shade,
Highways all Russia will unite
Him a disquietude did seize,
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
Himself transformed into a hack;
Him who inspired both love and awe,
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
His ardent soul with full delight.
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
His bit with foam besprinkled oâ€™er,
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
His breast was riddled through and through,
His butting horns in anger bent,
His care unto his pistolsâ€™ plight,
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
His chambers close wherein confined
His character attracted me.
His comedies, a noisy rout,
His constant soul could ever tire,
His course unto the running brook.
His cup unto his maiden dear.
His daily occupations, lo!
His daughterâ€™s book to ascertain
His ditties were as pure and bright
His double sashes and his grate,
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
His energy and impotence.
His entrance with OnÃ©guine. â€œAh!
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
His fate shall presently decide.
His fist OnÃ©guine fiercely shook
His footing on the treacherous rime
His friends and also enemies
His friendship I acquired just then;
His furs are powdered on the way
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
His harp beneath that sky had rung
His hate by slander, and who spends
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
His heart reciprocated still
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
His immorality of mind
His inner consciousness laid bare,
His intellect in close array.
His kneeling posture he retainsâ€”
His kneeling posture he retainsâ€”
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
His malady, whose cause I ween
His momentary loving glance
His mother from the door doth scold.
His mournful heart no peace could find,
His name: the tenderness of home
His neighbourâ€™s lowly tomb and mourned
His own antagonists expert,
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
His recent glory he invokes.
His relative and friend as well.
His ruffian bravery adored,
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
His son and mortgages his lands.
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
His son is married, just conceive!â€
His soul by crash of music fired,
His spirit sank with strange delight.
His spirit was intent upon.
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
His tea with rum no more desired,
His transports were quite maidenly,
His travels like all other things
His uncle, busy man indeed,
His valet brings him letters three.
His vanity first let us pique
His visit she had not awaited,
His wadded coat and cap with peak
His watch, the sun in turn he viewsâ€”
His weary head declined at rest,
His wife approaches, with him leads
His wife was also mad upon
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
Homeward returning, he at home
Honour and pride inflexible.
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
Hope with her fascinating power
Horror! had she not better stay
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
â€œHow Tania grows! Doth it appear
â€œHow are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
How artless was the note which spoke
How bitterly he would malign,
How bright and tender was his look,
â€œHow came you then to wed a man?â€â€”
How charming Olgaâ€™s shoulders grow!
How dark the night is getting though!
How deftly could he transport feign!
â€œHow dull you are this morning, nurse!â€
How empires store of wealth unfold,
However, Taniaâ€™s letter reading,
However cherries might abound,
However, the mazurka lacks
How flourish, why and wherefore less
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,â€â€”
How full of fire his speech would glow!
How in the country pass this time?
How like a poet was my chum
How like the billow I desired
Howl like a dolt: â€™tis meant for me!
How mean, how pusillanimous!
How meekly then I heard you preachâ€”
How meekly then I heard you preachâ€”
How much is in that word expressed!
â€œHow now, OnÃ©guine, yawning still?â€â€”
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
â€œHow often in thine arms I lay;
How oft the kindly Muse away
How oft to the Crimean shore
How oft, when on a summer night
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
How pleasantly the evening jogs
How sick to death his uncle lay
How soon he learnt deceptionâ€™s art,
How soon he learnt to titillate
How soon to habits she conformed
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
How the young imp on Tania doted!
How thoroughly her part she took!
How thy hands burn!â€â€”â€œDear nurse, Iâ€™m well.
How well he played the greenhornâ€™s part
How with thy medal I would play,
Hung like a print against the wall,
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Hymenâ€™s embarrassments, distress,
I Apuleius gladly read
I, after so much eloquence,
I also wandered there of old,
I am acquainted with fresh care,
â€œI am in love,â€ her whispers tell
I am in love, my hour hath come!
â€œI am in love, nurse! leave me now.â€
I amâ€”in loveâ€”you knowâ€”donâ€™t tell!â€
I am not strong enough to state;
I am not worthy them in aught;
I ask, all ye who poets are,
I blame not your behaviourâ€”
I blame not your behaviourâ€”
I by the button-hole seize fast
â€œI call to witness God on highâ€”â€
I cannot help it I declare,
I cannot tell on what pretenceâ€”
I cannot tell the reason why,
I cannot understand. But lo!
I canâ€™t conceive a little dear
I canâ€™t translate the adjective.
â€œI celebrate a comrade young
â€œIdeal,â€ he had drowsy grown.
â€œIdeas and time neâ€™er backward move;
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
I did not please you. Why pursue
I did not please you. Why pursue
Idolatry of liberty,
I envied sore the billows tall,
If Olga smilingly approve,
If but to lighten Timeâ€™s dull rate,
If cleverly or not I prate.
If he had only known the wound
If his hot hand encountered hers,
If in the scenes of home I might
If not, the money I will lend.â€
I formerly admired her much
If seriously he hath disease;
If the choice in my power were,
If the choice in my power were,
â€œIf the domestic hearth could blessâ€”
If the poor maiden could have guessed
If the raw product they possess
If they but heard domestic loads
If they were similar in aught.
If thou wert sitting by my side,
If wife and children to possess
I guard it as a holy thing,
I have dreamed many a vision fair
I have endured without respite.
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
I have known beauties cold and raw
I have no leisure here to dwell,
I just hint, in parenthesis,
I know not if his heart felt pain
I know that Parnyâ€™s tender pen
I know thereâ€™s none more amiable.
I lift a warning voice because
I like the difference to express
I like this word exceedingly
Iâ€™ll pass beneath the firmament,
Iâ€™ll sprinkle thee with holy water.â€”
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
I long by ballets have been bored,
I long enough deceived have erred.
I long have ceased to offend the laws.
I loved youâ€”what did I obtain?
I loved youâ€”what did I obtain?
I love its furious delight,
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
I love youâ€”to what end deceive?â€”
I love you with a brotherâ€™s love,
Imaginationâ€™s sacred fires,
I marriedâ€”now, I supplicateâ€”
Iâ€™m beaten in another matter;
I mean my name not to repeat.â€
â€œIâ€™m happy, say, is it not so?â€â€”
I might to connoisseurs repeat
Immersed in melancholy thought,
Immersed in secret thought I stand
Iâ€™m not for witchcraft now inclined.
Iâ€™m oâ€™er it ever pondering.
I mourn, but tears I cannot shedâ€”
Impatient, boiling oâ€™er with wrath,
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
Impatient waits the close of day,
Impelled by Springâ€™s dissolving beams,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
Impelled to union with his own
Imperial portraits hang around
Impetuously clove its way
Imploring looks and mute complaint
Imploring looks and mute complaint
Impressed him in the least degree,â€”
Impressionable for an hour,
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
I mused: perhaps the matterâ€™s squaredâ€”
I must resign myself, in sooth;
In Olgaâ€™s album, youthful maid,
In Olgaâ€™s and Tattianaâ€™s rooms
In Olgaâ€™s face no lifeâ€™s displayed.
In Russ her love made manifest,
In Taniaâ€™s praise in pouch he brought,
In age the memory gets worse,
In a half-open dressing-gown
In aimless ease and far from strife,
In a lax or informal way,
In amorous flights when so inspired,
In books he saw nought to condemn
In boston and the game of age,
In bud of promise incomplete,
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
Incessantly his chains to break.â€
In charming fashion mutilate?
Incited by his stormy Muse
In clouds of steam above perceive.
In coach or post-cart duly placed
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
In company, or simply bowed,
In consultation stand asideâ€”
In correspondence been allowed.
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
In country towns, where still it keeps
In course of time (the whole extent
In cruel solitude each day
Indeed, by force of magnetism
Indifferent he became to all,
Indifferent was her future fate.
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
In dreams and what the moon foretold
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
In duel having killed his friend
In fact, some people were assured
In fact, the subject analysed,
Infallibly you there will find
Inflict annoyance and distress
In former years thus did not I
â€œInform me, prince, pray dost thou know
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
In groups, official striplings glance
Inhabited the country, clad
In haunts of fashion where each day
In her affairs neâ€™er interfered,
In her friendsâ€™ albums, time had been,
Inheritor of all his race.
In history he took no pleasure,
In hopes of everlasting fame
In horror for itself alone,
In idleness and tranquil joy
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
In life domestic see a string
In little maidens of thirteen?
In love adventures she was versed,
In love, although its tempests vex,
In love-lorn meditation sad.
In loveâ€™s campaigns OnÃ©guine heard
In many things had changed his lifeâ€”
In melancholy loveliness,
In mist profound all yet is hid.
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
In mother Winterâ€™s strange caprice.
In motley and amusing chase.
In much his conduct stigmatized;
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
In my young days of wild delight
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
In old age life is weariness!â€
In one great shout: sheâ€™s mine! sheâ€™s mine!
In one he doth accounts behold,
In one of thine enchanting lays
In one thing really did excel.
In order due the maidens pull;
In pages of a love narration
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
In rhyming I show laziness.
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
In scenes like these it may be though,
Insensible her hand remains
Insensible her hand remains
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
Inseparable from our lot;
Inseparable soon they be.
Inseparable they remained.
In serious mood or dalliance
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
In silence shall I sit and yawn
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
In solid, unpretentious style,
In solitude or worldly din,
In some a willing martyrdom.
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
Inspired but weariness intense;
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
Inspired him with disgust and so
In spite of common sense weâ€™re wont
In spring-time, heard the cygnetâ€™s note
In springtime on the meadows green,
Instructed jestingly the boy,
In such an album with delight
Interrogation to denote.
In that morass where you and I
In the French language perfectly,
In the Lyceumâ€™s noiseless shade
In the beginning, cold and mute,
In the beginning of this lay,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
In the dawn of existence drear.
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
In the first place, say, am I right?
In their sterility of prattle,
In the lone garden and the lane?
In the lone garden and the lane?
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
In the meantime the mill inspects.
In the recesses what hath stirred
In the unfettered hours of leisure
In the unmoved, magnificent
In the worldâ€™s mortal revelries,
In the worldâ€™s vortex my success,
In this case quite mistaken was.
In this the love of the fair sex
In three weeks would arrive for them;
In thy imagination warm,
In time Iâ€™ll give ye without fail
In times gone by thy bare commandâ€”â€
Into accounts would sometimes look,
Into delicious bondage gave
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
Into the chamber where he slept
Into the cups already sped
Into the district then to boot
Into the lonely house she went,
Into the starry night extend.
Into the study of the boy
Into the tangled garden goes
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
Introduce verse in conversation.
In true interpretation hates:
In truth he had the happy trick
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
In vain was youth by us received,
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
Invigorate imagination
In what he merely acquiesced.
In whispers low the neighbours said:
In winter by its blank and dim
In winter on the fender bright,
In winter time would often come.
In winter, when Night longer holds
In worldly din or solitude
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
In your young days and also mine),
I once forgot for your sweet cause
I on my chosen hero dote;
I owe the censorship a little.
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
I promised!â€”Did I so?â€”Well, there!
I sail upon my lake at times
I say without poetic phrase,
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
Is ever ready to proclaim
Is ever ready with relief,
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
Is full of frigid jealousy,
â€œI shall expire,â€ Tattiana cried,
â€œIs he known to you?â€â€”â€œYes and No.â€
â€œIs he the same or grown more wise?
I should alarm our friendship tried:
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Is it for long?â€â€”â€œMa chÃ¨re cousine!â€
Is it not true? the objects fair,
Is it that I am now compelled
Is it that I am now compelled
Is it that ardent souls of flame
Is it that human restlessness
I slumber much, a little read,
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Is occupied with Olga fair,
Is once again made manifest.
Is once again made manifest.
(I speak not of our poems here),
Is petted by the Emperor?â€”
Is petted by the Emperor?â€”
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
â€œIs she in love?â€ quoth one. â€œWith whom?
Is still condemned in love to be;
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
I still a complication view,
Istomina(*) the nimbly-bounding;
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
It blew: it howled: till winter eâ€™en
It carries of antiquity
It gradually possessed his mind;
I thank thee. In thy company,
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
I the same admonition make.
It matters not. Hope eâ€™en to these
It may be that I did proceedâ€”
It may be that his martyred shade
It may be ye were born, or there
It now to investigate is time,
It occupied him from a boy,
I tried when I began this tale,
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
Its driver seated on the rim
Its ebullition foaming white
Its insignificance I know
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
Its passions and its modes of thought.
Its splendour and its blandishments,
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
It wakens in my breast again.
It was a cheery, generous
It whiled his idle hours away
It will be by a mob beset
I uttered to my lady fair
Ivan PetrÃ²vitch still a gaby,
Iâ€™ve had to make for having friends!
Iâ€™ve scanned it with a jealous eye,
Iâ€™ve thought well oâ€™er the general plan,
Iâ€™ve wasted in amusements vain,
I was for calm existence made,
I was half silly with affright.
I was incensed and he was sad.
â€œI weep. And if within your breast
â€œI weep. And if within your breast
I will descant on loveâ€™s sweet dream,
I will not wed, and ever weeps
I will with thy divinity
â€œI with my friend intend to fight!â€
â€œI wonâ€™t detain you; but â€™tis hard
I would desire my bride to beâ€”
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
I would your vigilance arouse,
I write, and anguish flies away,
I yield for splendid vanities,
I yield the fruit of work severe.
I yield with a low reverence;
Jackdaws on every spireâ€”in scores.
Jaws are at work. On every side
Jealousy and vexation took
Jiltedâ€”glad of a holiday.
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Judge then what roses would be ours,
Just as he entered. How severe!
Just at a moment which I grieve
Just at that time his father died,
Just at the hour we designate
Just at this moment I cannot.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Just manages a feeble trot
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
Just so! that modest swain is blest
Keep your accounts! Youâ€™d rather not?
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Known unto children perfectly:
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;
Ladies in crowds around her close,
Laid down his life of sun and storm
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
Landscapes thereon he would design,
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Late in the afternoon to rise,
Latest arrivalsâ€™ salutations,
Latin is just now not in vogue,
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
Lay languishing both day and nightâ€”
Lead into good society,
Leaning against the dam expects,
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
Learn to possess more self-control.
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
Lenski as a good match received,â€”
Lenski at intervals would dare,
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Lenski his pencil-case took out
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
Lenski the foemanâ€™s apparition
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
Lenski unto the dame replied,
Lessons to give he understood!
Lest jaded with satiety,
Lest the malicious reader or
Lest the world or her lord divine
Let me explain that in my song
Let me present ye to the man,
Let not the poetâ€™s spirit freeze,
Let us congratulations pay
Let us go seek a little restâ€”
Let us proceed unto a rill,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Light sallies without coxcombry,
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Like Leonora did she ride
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Like a Bacchante in her sport
Like a full moon magnificent.
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Like down from Aeolusâ€™s lip,
Like him renouncing vanity,
Like his, her dress was always nice,
(Like love, another sort of knavery!)
(Like other things I could relate)
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strownâ€”
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
Likewise an epitaph with tears
Like you and me and all the rest?â€”
Listen to me without disdain.
Listless is she the livelong day
List! the snow crunchesâ€”he draws nigh!
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Lo! in my garden was she found
Lo! my OnÃ©guine free as air,
Lo! my OnÃ©guine rural lord!
Long ago?â€â€”â€œâ€™Tis the second year.â€
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Longer the East inert reclines
Long in this fashionable cell
Long, long the hour had past when home
Long since I held thee at the fontâ€”
Longtime her mind is occupied.
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
Long time her young imagination
Long time in meditation deep
Longtime was her heart desolate
Long tortured by his lay divine,
â€œLook quickly to your left, my sweet!â€
Looks upon all with absent gaze
Look through the window and kill flies.
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
Lord Byronâ€™s portrait on the wall
Lost in the hamlet far away.
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
Lo! through the frozen windows play
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
Loveâ€™s pangs Tattiana agonize.
Loveâ€™s tender transports and distress,
Love to idealize inclined;
Love to inspire doth woe appear
Lo! with what pride celestial
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Made me so tipsy long ago!
Made revelations undesigned,
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Maidens before her meekly move
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Make up your mind to go there.â€â€”â€œAh!
Malek Adel and De Linar,
Malicious and a slanderer.
Malignant fury they disclose,
Manâ€”forty years long in this wiseâ€”
Many an ancient legend which
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
Mark ye with what a modest air
Marmontel also, tome the third;
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
May be, and this my terror wakes,
May be that I by heavenâ€™s decrees
May be the empire of the sense,
May find a crumb to satisfy.
May well in innocence impart.
May yet be studious of his nails;
â€œMe?â€â€”â€œYes! It is Tattianaâ€™s fÃªte
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Meantime Iâ€™ll finish whilst I can
Meantime OnÃ©guineâ€™s apparition
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Meantime in matutinal dress
Measured with great exactitude.
(_Mechanically_, let us add),
Meet punishment for him provide.
Men become friends from idleness.
Mends with the Russian hammerâ€™s blows
Men love no more, as only the
Men opposite. The cross they sign
Me now, inflict upon me pain?â€”
Me now, inflict upon me pain?â€”
Men will forget me, but my urn
Merciful God, what will he deem?â€
Method was dear unto his heart
Metreless verses recognizing
Me your perfections would not bless;
â€™Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
â€œMine!â€ cried Eugene with savage tone.
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
Minutely I will now portray.
Miraculously fair arise,
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
Modest yet daring! And a tear
Moina recalls for this alone
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
â€œMonsieur lâ€™AbbÃ©â€ a starving Gaul,
Morality taught scarce at all;
More advantageously appear
More blooming than the Boreal flame
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
More crimson every moment they.
More satisfaction to her taste.
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
More timid than a doe long chased,
More troublesome than usual?â€â€”â€œNo!
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
Morningâ€™s forerunners, breezes blow
Mortally sick I am indeed.
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
Moscowâ€™s young Graces at her stare,
Most by this circumstance offended
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Most usually a Cossack horse
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
Mountains weâ€™ll level and through deep
Mournful Loveâ€™s deadly trace appears
Mournful is thine approach to me,
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
Must be pronounced unfortunateâ€”
Must bow in common courtesy;
Must eâ€™en despise his kind at last;
Must now my stanzas occupy.
Must take a walk and rest a bitâ€”
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
Mute glances interchanged aside
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
Mutual destruction to contrive.
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
My beauty, thou art ready too.
â€œMy chum lives here,â€ Bruin grunts out.
My country and an exileâ€™s lot;
My countryâ€™s honour and repute
â€œMy darling child, thou art in pain.â€”
â€œMy darling, growing old am I!
My famous portrait indicate
My friends, the poet ye regret!
My friends, what means this odd digression?
My friend, â€™tis but to pay a debt,
My frivolous and jolly youth.
My goddesses, where are your shades?
My gratitude do not disdain,
My heart of old would captivate.
â€œMy heartâ€™s delight, thou art not well.â€â€”
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
My image hath not disappeared,
My image hath not disappeared,
My joy in youth was fleeting eâ€™en
My light productions to retain,
My little book. With thee I knew
My lot is fixedâ€”with thoughtlessness
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
My memory wandered wide and sought
My morning birdie, yesternight
My mother-in-law who lately died
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
My pen no longer finds delight,
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
My pretty self-deceiving maidâ€”
My scholar without aptitude
â€œMy second!â€ cried in turn Eugene,
My soul I cannot renovateâ€”
My soul is filled with gratitude!
My soul is filled with gratitude!
My spirit and my blood doth move,
My spirit with such pangs before.
My splendid house and gaietiesâ€”
My sportive Muse I used to take
Mysteriously all objects near
My sum of happiness contained;
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
ï»¿â€œMy uncleâ€™s goodness is extreme,
My unpretending page shall fill,
My venerated reader, oh!
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
My very latest composition!
My word of honour given have I.
My wretched Lenskiâ€™s fate I mourn,
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
Napoleon tarried till it please
Nay, nearâ€”but destiny decreedâ€”
Near Kharitonâ€™s in a side street
Nearer they comeâ€”Eugene appears!
Nearest and dearest knew not how
Near young Tattiana resident,
Neâ€™er touched her fingers indolent
Neâ€™er trusted to the treacherous ace.
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
Never for me to reappearâ€”
Never upon my heroine
Next Saturday. The LÃ rina
Night separated from her spouse,
No answer! He another sent.
No answer all that day was borne.
Noblesse and models of the mode,
No coquetry was there, I vouchâ€”
No fond illusions live to soothe,
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
No greater pleasure can exist
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
No longer through her former home;
â€œNo matter, look immediately.
â€œNo misery I see in thatâ€â€”
No more at dawn the shepherd will
No more remembered him; unto
No more the music thunders loud,
No more the village knows his face,
No more with pale Dianaâ€™s rays,
None, be my witness Heaven above!
None could a trace of that impute,
None could her beautiful declare,
None the conviction could withstand
No, never in the early blaze
No noveltyâ€”is it not true?â€”
No noveltyâ€”is it not true?â€”
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
No obstacle of which I know.
No one appeared to lend a hand.
No one the contrary will urge,
No other book had time to read.
No other than OnÃ©guine mine.
Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor boston nor the worldâ€™s affairs
Nor by her beauty she became
Nor by her sisterâ€™s brilliancy
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Nor did her blushes fade away,
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
Nor discontinued to distress
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
Nor even tears afford respite,
Nor frigid adulation paid.
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
Nor further comment that night made.
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Nor long his mind was agitated
Nor marked how summerâ€™s prime had fled
Nor on the letter yet hath she
Nor precepts sage nor pictures eâ€™en,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Nor shall the caterpillar come
Nor slander viciously could spread
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Nor the frost particles inhale
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Nor years of separation all
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
No senseless fashionable lay
No sense was ever manifest
No signs of trouble her accused,
Not a bad fellow was her father
Not agony, but death expressed.
Not all will like myself proceedâ€”
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
â€œNot at all.â€â€”â€œThat I canâ€™t conceive!
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
Not even a poetic phrase,
Not high in general estimation;
â€œNothing, good nurse, thereâ€™s nothing wrong,
No time to pick it up! afraid,
â€œNot in the least, assured am I!â€â€”
Not knowing its interpretation,
Not only sorrowâ€”Ah! my dear,
No trace ye left in passing by
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
Not so! My Moscow never went
Not that she had his works perused,
Not the least trace OnÃ©guine sees
Not the young timid maid, believe,
Not to behave as he did onceâ€”
Nought but of dinners a long row,
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Nought in the universe refused:
Nought of its charms original
November at the gate did stand.
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!â€
Now I am fit for nothing here.
Now I am ready to refuse.
Now all things round about repeat
Now a long branch itself entwined
Now, as in a deserted house,
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Now donâ€™t be cross with me, my soul,
Now for the first time I my Muse
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
Now her lithe form she arches oâ€™er
Now it is ready to be sentâ€”
Now, like hereditary foes,
Now of a family the head,
Now talkative, now reticent;
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
Now with what eager interest
â€œNurse, leave me. I would be alone.
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
â€œNurse, â€™tis so close I cannot rest.
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
O Men, how very like ye are
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
Obedient she had ever been
Obedient then to Natureâ€™s law,
Obedient to the magic strings,
Obedient to warm Springâ€™s commands.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?â€”
Oblivion of lifeâ€™s tempest dire,
Obsequious or indifferent!
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
O epic Muse, my powers increase
Oâ€™er all a sheet of silvery dust
Oâ€™er hillock and oâ€™er meadow throws.
Oâ€™er my remains to drop a tear,
Oâ€™erspread with Winterâ€™s carpet bright,
Oâ€™erwhelmed with guests; by families
Of Africa, ancestral land,
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
Of Levshinâ€™s school ye followers,
Of London life is â€œvulgarâ€ called
Of Olga he in song averred;
Of Russian domesticity;
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
Of affectation innocent,
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Of all the guests within his mind.
Of a most mournful episode,
Of a strange night when the moon andâ€”
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
Of censure for the same incurred;
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
Of â€œcomme il faut.â€ ShishkÃ²ff, forgive!
Of consolation all bereftâ€”
Of conversation, thought and aimsâ€”
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
Of creditors a hungry rout
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
Of dreary Russia left behind,
O feet, whereâ€™er your path extends
Of error and the passionsâ€™ strife.
Of every sort and every set!â€â€”
Of fashionable dames the foe,
Of fiery youthâ€™s untutored days
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
Of foreign whims the impersonationâ€”
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
Of friends the grateful intercourseâ€”
Of friends unceremonious would
Of frivolous existence, friends;
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Of her provincial innocence
Of his approach; but nothing cared
Of horn in circle call them round.
Of keen sarcastic intellect
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of languor and of love did tell
Of late I have been quite absurd,â€”
Of life or death predestinate.
Of love again, and yet again;
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Of many an economic scheme;
Of migratory gipsy hordesâ€”
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
Of modern Russians the disease.
Of my impassioned heroine.
Of my light paramour was proud.
Of old maids the divinity,
Of passion reminiscences,
Of passion they so often raise.
Of pictures painful harrowing,
Of priceless value all things seem
Of roses to romancers dear;
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
Of such a dread hallucination.
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
Of tender years the modesty
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
Of the commencement of the piece.
Of the cup brimming oâ€™er with wineâ€”
Of the domains of the side-scene.
Of the horizon she is like!â€â€”
Of the imperial Nevaâ€™s shore.
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Of the Ã†neid, but incorrect.
Of the night sentinels arise
Of the romances she preferred,
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Of touching lightly every theme.
Oft staring through the window pane
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Of untold gain she must conceal,
Of what he thought and what believed,
Of what not, and of distant dim,
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Of whirligigs were very fond,
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Oh! I accept. And instantly
â€œOh! I remember, where is he?â€â€”
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
â€œOh! how our years are vanishing!â€
Oh, many a year hath run its course
â€œOh! nurse, nurse, you donâ€™t understand!
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
â€œOh! what a fool our neighbour is!
Oh! what had been his eminence!
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
â€œOh! whither have ye winged your way,
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Oh! who is not calumnious?
Old age through spectacles too peers,
Old peopleâ€™s simple conversations
Old women at the coachmen swear.
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
Olga began to long likewise
Olga he sees before his eyes
Olga ran skipping from the door.
Olgaâ€™s admirer came that day:
Olga the tea must superviseâ€”
Olga with trepidation dire.
â€œOlinka is her junior, see.
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
On Lenskiâ€™s matrimonial fate
On Sundays by yon window he,
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
On balls I madly used to dote,
Once more to idleness consigned,
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
(One and the same thing it may be)
One image occupied his mind,
One instrument for his own useâ€”
One momentâ€™s slumber suffer not.
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
On everything around her gaze,
On fresh allurements they are bent,
On guests their servants used to wait
â€œOnÃ©guine, I was younger then,
â€œOnÃ©guine, I was younger then,
OnÃ©guine Olga bore away.
OnÃ©guine, O my gentle readers,
OnÃ©guine acted very well
â€œOnÃ©guine, all this sumptuousness,
OnÃ©guine, bored to death again,
OnÃ©guine, by first impulse moved,
OnÃ©guine could not now submit,
OnÃ©guine firedâ€”Alas! alas!
OnÃ©guine, hast forgotten yet
OnÃ©guine, hast forgotten yet
OnÃ©guine his excuses says;
OnÃ©guine knew enough, the rogue
OnÃ©guine lightning glances shot;
OnÃ©guine meditative stood,
OnÃ©guine neâ€™er as poet showed
OnÃ©guine oped the cupboards wide.
OnÃ©guine sat the table by
OnÃ©guineâ€™s cheek grew ashy pale,
OnÃ©guineâ€™s letter!â€â€”â€œAh! the thing!
OnÃ©guine slowly then began
OnÃ©guineâ€™s pencillings. His mind
OnÃ©guineâ€™s speeches I abhorred
OnÃ©guineâ€”take him up againâ€”
OnÃ©guineâ€”the beloved place
OnÃ©guine then approached and said:
OnÃ©guine to the window went
OnÃ©guine waits on us, â€™tis like.â€
OnÃ©guine was a citizen
OnÃ©guine wasâ€”so many deemed
OnÃ©guine wasted; on my word,
OnÃ©guine was the most impressed,
OnÃ©guine went with trepidation
OnÃ©guine whither gallops? Ye
On him spleen mounted sentinel
On horseback every day they rideâ€”
On horseback gallop oâ€™er the steppe!
On innocent delights I dote,
On iron bridges we shall gaze
On lines invisible are fixt;
Only her countenance assumed
On melted wax in water poured;
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
On such a day. O Heavens, â€™tis she!
On sunny days the glistening rime,
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
On the dull stage find all things changed,
On thee I used to meditate!
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
On this artistical retreat
On unknown female forms he throws.
On us beyond the grave attends,
On waves by tempests curdled oâ€™er!
On whom a sisterâ€™s heart was set
On winters of the south a skit,
Opened the portals of the tomb
Opened with care, and entering bore
Openly or â€™neath decent cloak.
Opens unto her visitor.
Open the windowâ€”sit by me.â€
Oppressive now is happiness,
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
Or Bogdanovitchâ€™s sweet lays.
Or â€œIdol mio,â€ and in the grate
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
Or, after dinnerâ€™s dull repast,
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Or any trifle else ye like
Or a professor in tulle cap.
Or, as it were, the Freischutzâ€™ score
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
Or a swift meteor, may be,
Or at a promenade mayhap,
Or better,â€”like a faithful wife.
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
Or bosom full of languid fire,â€”
Or but for fame he saw the light;
Or by a card our homage pay,
Or by the oceanâ€™s rocky shore.
Or counting on his uncleâ€™s death
Or couplets more ingenious still;
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Or eâ€™en Istomina, my dear,
Or eâ€™en the â€œDemonâ€ of my strain.
Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
Or even overcome by wrath
Or even, silent and resigned,
Or faults of grammar on its pageâ€”
Or for the solitary tomb
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
Or, heedless of the leavesâ€™ return
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Or if he meant to flirt again,
Original imagination,
Or in a squabble to engage,
Or innocently past me fly.
Or into bold hands anxiously
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
Or kiss the border of her dress.
Or letters of a maiden young.
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Or, parable more flattering,
Or parody of modern ways?
Or quietly partake our woe.
Or recognized not in the crowd.
Or reconciled them, it may be,
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
Or that adoring Grandison
Or the delivery of a note.
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
Or vainly â€™mid luxurious fare
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
Or will my melancholy glance
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
Other and colder thoughts affright,
O triumphs of my guileless days,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Our dear old aunt, Princess HelÃ¨ne,
Our fathers used to dote upon;
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
Our hero stops and doth alight,
Our idol, Honourâ€™s motive force,
Our liberty at least survives:
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
Ourselves as unities to count;
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
Our union would produce but grief.
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
Outlandish and provincial,
Outside descend the mists of night.
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared.â€
O ye whom tender love hath pained
Page after page continued reading,
Pair after pair the race sustain.
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
Pallid and melancholy face,
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Pardon I ask for such a sinâ€”
Paris and Menelaus right.
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Passed into dull eternity,
Passes the torrent But alack!
Passionâ€™s wild sway I then allowed,
Past darkened windows and long streets
Past palaces and nunneries,
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Pedantic although scholar like,
Pen, paper bring: the table too
Perceived that he was still beloved,
Perchance he will to all the three.
Perchance one more affectionate.
Perchance some heart â€™twill agitate,
Perchance they laurels also cullâ€”
Perchance to benefit mankind,
Perchance upon the Neva eâ€™en
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
Perchance you also soon may burn,
Perched on a gooseâ€™s neck a skull
Perish absorbed by Letheâ€™s stream.
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!â€â€”
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
Pervaded with much common sense.
Perverse, unfavourable views?
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Philanthropist or patriot,
Philosopher just turned eighteen.
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
Placed at the customary range;
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
PÃ©lagie Nikolavna has
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Poetical enthusiast,
Poetic transport. They impart
Poetic transport did infuse,
Polite demeanour to preserve,
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
â€œPoor Yorick,â€ mournfully he said,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Portrayed contemporary man
Portray the solitary den
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
Possession hath no power to please,
Possess my love and sympathy.
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Pray is it he? It is the same.
Pray is it not a tough affair
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
Present me.â€â€”â€œYou are joking.â€â€”â€œNo.â€â€”
Presents her quarto amiably,
Preserves and an eternal prattle
Prevailed at last. She in reply
Priams of country populations
â€œPrincesse, mon ange!â€â€”â€œPachette!â€â€”â€œAline!â€
Proceeds, until she from a hill
Professions eagerly for deeds,
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
PÃ©tÃ²ushkoff met the selfsame doom.
PÃ©tÃ²ushkoff, the provincial swell;
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
Quarrels among young friends he bred
_Quâ€™ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
Quick to the country let us wend
Quite a sensation; the position
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
Raged round him and of balked desire!
Raises within my breast as oft
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
Rebuffedâ€”as quickly reassured,
Received him freely at her house,
Recent instructions of its mother.
Recovering, Tania gazes round;
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Reform me both in deed and word,
Regained authority awhile,
Rekindled in my withered heart
Relate some ancient history.â€
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Remained with him the youthful maid.
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
Remarkable. She then indeed
Removed her to his country seat,
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
Repentance wields not now her spell
Replaced them in their box, undressed
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Repose from labour, satire keen,
Repose her silken curtains fled,
Repose in peace, thou child of song_.â€
Rescue me from oblivion.
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Resounding through all ages might
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
Retained the image, though short-lived,
Returning, from his ship amid
_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.
Reviews both dress and countenance,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Rings from a dish of water full
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
Romance of love I pray refer,
Romances pleased her from the first,
Romances three, in which ye scan
Rooted unto the spot remained.
Round which revolves the universe.
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Russiaâ€™s Terpsichore review
Said something in an undertone
Sailed silently in unisonâ€”
Sails her allotted course on high,
Saint Priest, who every albumâ€™s page
Sang childhoodâ€™s pastimes and its joy,
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
Satan will jest, and at loveâ€™s cost.
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
â€œSay, of the two which was Tattiana?â€
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
Scarce to her questions he responds,
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
Scornfully challenged you afieldâ€”
Seated, a curious look with glasses
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
Secure in rural quietudeâ€”
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
Seductive, animated, bright,
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
See, I can hardly crawl aboutâ€”
Seeing in this no deprivation,
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
Seek the forgotten countenance
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
(See the first canto if ye will),
Selfish nonentities around?
Serious endeavours to assure
Servant of God and brigadier,
Serve who could neither read nor write.
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
Shaking with serious air the head,
Shall I behold thee once again?â€â€”
â€œShall I proceed, or homeward flee?
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Shall abdicate the bardâ€™s profession,
Shall my declining years beguile;
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
â€œShall we commence?â€â€”â€œLet it be so,â€
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
She bows her head beneath the crown;
She brought with her the gift of song.
She buries deep within her breast
She calm and unconcerned appears.
She cannotâ€”Eugene oped the door
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
She cannotâ€”then impatiently
She comprehends. The simple maid
She comprehends. The simple maid
She consolation thence obtainedâ€”
She could not sleep in her new bed.
She deemed its outline might afford.
She did not think â€œprocrastination
She dreamt she journeyed oâ€™er a field
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
She enters a deserted yardâ€”
She fears and like an arrow rushes
She fears she cannot.â€”Cannot? Why?â€”
She found herself alone at last,
She from the winter corn espies
She gazedâ€”a cue, forgotten long,
She gazed around herâ€”it was day.
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
She got a book of nursery tales,
She heard of servant-maids the note,
She hears of conversation nought
She hears the bear behind her press,
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
She hesitates, in doubt is thrownâ€”
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She is an angel! We sometime
She led me through nocturnal mist
She leisurely away doth ride,
She loved upon the balcony
She mourned and to the moon would raise
She murmurs in an undertone
She muses: â€œWhat was Olgaâ€™s fate?
She neâ€™er repeated unto hers.
She nerves herself from her alarm
She never more his face may view,
She never of deception dreamed
She on the apparition gazed,
She oped her eyes and cried: â€™tis he!
She peeped through a chink of the door.
She promised Eugene, or she would
She roseâ€”departed. But Eugene
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
She sank.â€”â€œHeâ€™s here! Eugene is here!
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
She seeks the garden in her needâ€”
She seemed of him oblivious,
She sits aloneâ€”â€™tis ever _she!_
She soon forgot, began to call
She starts, nor doth a word express,
She starts, nor doth a word express,
She strains her throat to force a cryâ€”
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
She, than the morning moon more pale,
She the acquaintances she loves,
She the delicious novel reads,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
She visited the humble tents
She waited forâ€”I donâ€™t know whom!
She waits, on fire her trembling frameâ€”
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
She was as heedless and as gayâ€”
She was thus fond of Richardson
â€œShe who with melancholy face
She will not see, she will not hear.
She wore her corset tightly bound,
She would pronounce _Ã  la FranÃ§aise_;
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
Shines in the female firmament
Shone pungent Satireâ€™s dauntless king,
Should be respected throughout life
Should dearly like a dance again.
Should go, the market for a maid,
Should make me much more circumspect,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
Shouts, laughter, jamming â€™gainst the wall,
Shouts of applause! OnÃ©guine passes
Shrill sang the _samovar_ at eve,
Shy, silent did the maid appear
Sickness more courage doth command
Sighs on another than her lord
Silent, oracular yeâ€™d see him
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
Silvers the brook; the shepherdâ€™s horn
Simeon PetrÃ²vitch just as shabby;
Similar dames ye may have seen.
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Since Eugene in that solitude
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Since I beheld Eugene and young
Since in these arms I thee did bearâ€”
Since leisure was together spent,
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
Singing God knows what maid admired,
Singing in chorus all the while.
Singing inside her hut the maid
â€œSit down. How funny, to be sure!
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Sits down and gazes on all sidesâ€”
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Slept oâ€™er the river misty grown.
Slow circling round its fellow swings
Slowly exhausted by desire,
Slumber still oâ€™er him lingering flies.
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
So Tania to her heartâ€™s content
So ancient warriors, battles oâ€™er,
So ardently did I desire
So be it! Just the laws which bid
Society endures not such!
Society he duped enow.â€
Society renounced once more.
So frequently his mind would stray
So from the mountain lazily
So full of piety, correct,
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
So inaccessible to men,
So irremissible appear?
So let us to the ball-room haste,
So many neighbours here existâ€”
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
Some Russian authors he perusedâ€”
Some a mazurka occupies,
So meantime let him joyous live
Some are afar and some are dead.
Some army poet therein may
Some day Iâ€™ll somehow finish it.
Some future ignoramus shall
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
Some marriageable maids behold,
Some nice instructive novel read,
Some one or other editor
Some other long-departed Spring,
Sometime collected, shall relate
Sometimes by pleasing flatteryâ€™s art,
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
Some wretched journal in his hand;
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruitâ€”
Soon Olgaâ€™s accents shrill resound
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
So prudent, and so circumspect
Sorrow to counterfeit and wailâ€”
So she her silken sash unlaced,
So she in French herself expressed.
So there will be a dance to-night.
â€œSo thou art wed! I did not know.
(So â€™twas with us in former years,
So uncongenial to my mind,
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
So, when he came next day to call,
Spanned the unbridled torrent oâ€™er;
Spared him not their asperities.
Spare yourself unavailing pain
Spectacles upon nose, all day
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
Speech was so tame and colourless
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
Spite of herself with Lenskiâ€™s lot
Spoiled children most degenerate
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
Springâ€™s paramour, pours forth her song
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
Sterner solicitudes engage,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Still certain authors, I may add,
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
Still everywhere, without, within,
Still happier he who neâ€™er hath known!
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
Still of his club he member wasâ€”
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
Straight for the entrance then he made
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
Straight from their province had he come?â€â€”
Strange unto her each childish game,
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
Strictly the Carnival observed,
Striking the intellect with awe
Struck Lenski deadâ€”across the scene
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl oâ€™er.
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Submissive as if in a swoon,
Subscribed, _toujours Ã  vous, Annette;_
Successfully to please her tried,
Such am I. This did ye expect,
Such is the country custom good;
Such open-hearted innocence.
Such was OnÃ©guineâ€™s sainted life,
Such were the musings of Eugene.
Suddenly to the left hand side,
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
Surely ye all have overhauled
(Surely you know him as I speak);
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Swift following in her wake, the sun,â€
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
Take to their wings and fly away.
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Tania doth by the casement linger
â€œTania, my eldest child, you knowâ€â€”
Tania, observed by nobody,
Tania the meaning would obtain
Tania well nigh expired when he
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quickâ€”
Tattiana by a poor auntâ€™s side,
Tattiana certainly infers
Tattiana courage doth regain
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
Tattiana every day conferred
Tattiana faltered, and became
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
Tattiana from the hill descends
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
Tattiana gently led them there.
Tattiana in a misty dream,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Tattiana in the yard appears
Tattiana in the young princess!
Tattiana in the young princess!
Tattiana in traditions old
Tattiana learns the intelligenceâ€”
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Tattiana more than ever burned
Tattiana motionless abides.
Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
Tattiana oâ€™er the stream complained;
Tattiana purchased with a stray
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?â€â€”
Tattiana saw with trepidation
Tattianaâ€™s beauty, pale with care,
Tattianaâ€™s eyes with tender gleam
Tattianaâ€™s letter I possess,
Tattianaâ€™s love was quite sincere,
Tattianaâ€™s trouble might have spied,
Tattiana suffered secretly;
Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
Tattiana terrified awoke.
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Tattianaâ€”thus the sex is born.â€”
Tattiana to a corner, bids
Tattiana to the index flies
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Tattiana was her appellation.
Tattiana with impatience waited
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Tattiana would have gladly heard
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
â€œTell me, why doth your comrade stay?â€
Tender and elevated, free?
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
Terpsichore alone among
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
Terror assails her. Hastily
Terror of guardians of the night;
Than cold OnÃ©guineâ€™s oddities,
Than health, so with a trembling hand
Than oneâ€™s own fascinating self.
That Heaven her character had blent
That I am rich, a princeâ€™s wife?â€”
That I am rich, a princeâ€™s wife?â€”
That I forget not whom I sing.
That Ninaâ€™s marble symmetry,
That a friendâ€™s arm in every case
That afterwards with evil smile
That all may hear his voiceâ€™s tone.
That bilberry wine, Iâ€™m sore afraid,
That certain volumes she might read.
That chosen heroes consecrate,
That crass stupidity misleads,
That every morn at Verreyâ€™s cost
That first the Muse appeared to me.
That for that matter in my verse
That, for the century designed,
That girlâ€”but he must dreaming beâ€”
That girl whom once on a time he
That grandmothers and grandsires may
That guests approach: and when above
That heart with inspiration sweet
That hero, though his merit shone,
That he was â€œready any day.â€
That is, he could elucidate
That like a friendly voice its tone
That mediocrity alone
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
That my dishonour would ensure
That my dishonour would ensure
That our desires which noblest seemed,
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
That the two friends with morningâ€™s light
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
That until Christmas comes again
That vanished are my youthful days
That vicious set whom I donâ€™t blameâ€”
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
That we her constantly betrayed
That year the autumn season late
That youthful heartâ€”â€œBut, now at least,
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
The German baker looks around
The God of Love is after you!
â€œThe Lord be with thee, O my daughter!â€â€”
The Lord deliver her and save!
The Lovelaces are out of date,
The LÃ rinas unwisely went,
The LÃ rinas were since sunrise
The LÃ rinas would celebrate,
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
The Muse abandoned, taâ€™en a wife,
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
The Muse capricious let us coax,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
The Nevaâ€™s Cleopatra, and
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
The Paris of those country parts
The Princess N. will be at home
The Russian N with nasal sound
The Russian language I deem vile
The Russian winter did adore
The accents wild of otherâ€™s woes,
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
The aged nurse in ample gown,
The aged woman in her woe:
The all-entrancing joys of loveâ€”
The altar flame was quenched in night.
The amatory science warm,
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
The artful prisoner should seek
The aspect of a landscape drear.
The avalanche of snow first bends,
The ball in all its splendour shone.
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
The bard his answer waits at home,
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
The bardâ€™s enthusiastic strain,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
The bays of age and helplessness.
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
The bee forth from his cell of wax
The beldam saith: â€œThe hearth, by it
The blessings of humanity.
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
The body they consigned to rest,
The boy was wild but full of grace.
The break of day she doth not see,
The breath of Spring again renewed,
The bridegroom sage without delay
The bridge and alley to the lake,
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
The butt of scandal having been,
The calm existence which I prize
The captain of a company.
The captives of the Salguirâ€™s shore.
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
The chaise long ordered please employ,
The channel of the river stilled
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
The child of sloth and liberty.
The china teapot too ye might
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
The clue unto some mystery
The coach before a house stood still.
The coach is borne oâ€™er ruts and holes,
The cold reply with gloomy mien
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
The coming of lifeâ€™s Autumn drear.
The company deep silence guard.
The comrade of your youth should strike,
The connoisseur his glances throws
The contact of the foot I raised
The conversation tedious
The conversation was revived
The converse of our hermits twain,
The converse of the world polite,
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
The counsel good and full of reason,
The country hath its liberties
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
The crash of music, candlesâ€™ glare
The credulous indeed are blest,
The crowd and merriment and light,
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
The crystals of her vestibule
The curs away to kennel chase,
The curse of commonplace delight.
The curtain now they slowly raise.
The cynosure of every eye.
The damsel under escort place.
â€œ_The date, his fleeting years how longâ€”
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
The days of love and of romance!
The days which to your youth belong?
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
The deuce with my inside has played.â€
The disenchanted glass direct
The door flew openâ€”Olga came,
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The drama of my youth was played.
The dream left terror in its train.
The drive becomes monotonousâ€”
The drum already doth arouse.
The dusty chronicles of earth
The early days of life we sought.
The early tinkling of the bells
The easier â€™tis to gain her grace,
Thee but a little space bewept,
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
The epistle from the bard presents.
The epitaph on marble shows:
The evanescent fashions fly
The excited hero in a trice
The eyes of a grave general.
The fair, nor parted with regret,
The fair of the next generation,
â€œThe family are all quite wellâ€”
The family of Kharlikoff,
The family of children hie.
The fashionable rhymesterâ€™s heart!
The fatal bullet penetrate,
The fatal hour had come at lastâ€”
The fatal secrets of the grave,
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
The fated nutriment desired;
The father scarcely understands
The feeble moment would espy
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The feet of my dear lady friends.
The fervid poet would recite,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
The fires of passion and its smartâ€”
The firmament in mellow light,
The first appearance of the snows
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
The fisherâ€™s fire afar illumes
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
The forests in mysterious gloom
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
The freshness of her heart impair,
The friend of liberty and laws
The friends are called and quickly placed.
The fruits of learning and combined
The fruits of science, evil, good,
The general who accompanies.
The giddy world at last shall see.
The gifted songster never swerved,
The gilding of lifeâ€™s vanities,
The girl in marriage they unite.
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
The glass unwittingly inspect
The goblet still is bubbling brightâ€”
The goddess would a masquerade
The golden ember now enshrines,
The gossip of their ladies fair.
The guests make room; aside each takes
The gulf between them was so vast,
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
The happiest days of life employ?
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
The hero is of my narration!
The heroâ€™s name too in advance,
The hero we immortalize.
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
The horizon luminous doth grow,
The hostess doth interrogate:
The hours once more OnÃ©guine counts,
The hour whenâ€”Fate so willedâ€”we met
The hour whenâ€”Fate so willedâ€”we met
The house and garden I would see.â€
The household property contain:
The household troop of little boys,
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
The husband comes and interferes
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
The idols of their adoration
The image of her seal impressed.
The imagination to enliven
The indignation of her heart!
The inmate is for ever dumb,
The â€œin memoriamâ€ pages sought,
The inscription oâ€™er the gates of Hell
The insensate fire of love still glowed
Their Jealousy and separation
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
Their claims and explanations shout.
Their coming which no man expects,
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
Their giddy sports she neâ€™er enjoyed.
Their glory with their heels of red
Their harmless conversation blends
Their heroes used to represent
Their idols they were wont to invest
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
Their memory lingers still and seems
Their natural attractions lend
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Their offspringâ€™s innocent flirtations
Their own productions, some insist
Their privileged allurements fire
Their slander eâ€™en was weariness;
Their voices nought to her impart
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
The kennel or a kindred line,
The ladiesâ€™ dresses airy, light,
The ladiesâ€™ laughter to provoke.
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
The lady in the crimson cap
The ladyâ€™s glance upon him fellâ€”
The lamps illuminating shine;
The lancer, to his calling bound,
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
The language of her girlish pleading
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
The languid mind could smile at nought,
The last poor obol I was worthâ€”
The laws of generations past,
â€œThe left? Why, what on earth is there?â€â€”
The less we love a lady fair
The letter is the thing, you see,â€”
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
The lilyâ€™s stem to eat away,
The limits of enlightenment
The little solitary nook
The lively trash of stories long
The lonely mansion-house to screen
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
The maiden at her casement sits
The maidenâ€™s weary eye which yearned,
The maids beside Tattiana keepâ€”
The maid whose note he still possessed
The malady of hopeless love
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
The man and liked his company,
The manly toga scarce assumed,
The manners of the highest class
The master always used to sit.
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
The matter by his conscience tried,
The matter did not agitate,
The medium is required of gold.
The memory of the bard, a dream,
The memory of the bard was driven
The men salute with lower bows
The military band will play.
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
The miserable bard to meet,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
The moderns of the ancients raveâ€”
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
The monsters of the British Muse
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
The moon, the stars, and shining nightâ€”
The morn arises foggy, cold,
The most industrious man alive
The motley moving mass and bright,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
The mystic lines to tear away
The mystic monogram, O. E.
Then, I say truly, none but thee
â€œThen amongst strangers I was leftâ€”
The native Russian tongue impeach?
The natural fickleness of passion,
Then became busy with the house,
â€œThen come with me.â€ The prince proceeds,
Then dressed himself...
The needle nor, oâ€™er framework bent,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
The new moonâ€™s crescent slim she spied,
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
Then glittering in the sun descends.
Then handed her the song with grace.
Then heâ€™d malign them secretly
Then, her distraction to allay,
The nightingale there all night long,
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
The nights of golden Italy
â€œThen, in the country, isâ€™t not true?
â€œThen, in the country, isâ€™t not true?
Then in the silent cabinet
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Then my companions young with pleasure
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
â€œThen send your grandson quietly
Then suddenly discharge a joke
Then, the far capital forgot,
Then, thenâ€”well, in some solitude
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
Then they came easily enow,
Then theyâ€™re so innocent of vice,
Then to reward such confidence
Then to some gallant in your turn
Then touching Olga they depart
Then weeping she sank back distressed
Then would we muse as in a trance,
Then ye were barely generous,
The old Derjavine noticed me,
The olden time shall be my theme.
The old man who has had his freaks,
The opportunity is flown.
The pains of night have wholly fled,
The pall of night was growing thin,
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
The passionate speeches Iâ€™ll repeat,
The path of hope and tender fearâ€”
The path which leads to gloryâ€™s goal.
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
_The peasants there are rich as kings,
The perfidies I recollect
The pervert world with icy chill
The pile of books, with carpet spread
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
The poet fell; already men
The poet from Tamboff secured,
The poet, modest though so grand,
The poetâ€™s fervid conversation
The poetâ€™s hour hath soundedâ€”See!
The poetâ€™s madness? for â€™tis hard
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
The poor girl fell into a faint,
â€œThe post hath kept him, it is like.â€
The powder in the pan is laid,
The prejudices all men have,
The princeâ€™s eye OnÃ©guine seeks:
The princess from the sofa cried
The proud ones are not worth the fire
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
There Didelot became glorious,
There an imperious skeleton;
There, aping Gulnareâ€™s bard, he spanned
The reaping girls approach and ply
There came a sudden flash of light,
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
There friends of pure delight had been
There, in that knot of company,
There is a spot the village near
There is no fishmarket retort
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
There is no stupid calumny
There is no wreath upon the bough:
There jars of cider block the way,
Thereâ€™ll be a fight. I do not lie.
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
Thereon the passing traveller read:
There our KatÃ¨nine did revive
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
There, there, beneath the side-sceneâ€™s shade
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
There was no angling for success.
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
There, when the rains of spring we mark
The rigour of cold pride and all
The riot of the world and glare
The riverâ€™s bank. Tattiana lone
The river through the linden wood.
The room my former master used.
The ruts of his own fatherland.
The sad moon only could remark.
The same unmoved oblivion
The same warm vision constantly;
These are your relatives, believe:
The secrets of the marriage state
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
These evenings as in days of old
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
The serpent to unlawful trees
The servants used to congregate
These take their seats; the coach of state
These to the coach of state are bound,
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
The sharp incisions of his nail,
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
The shining orbs of night appear;
The shining pistols are uncased,
The shining river clothed in ice;
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The shutters open; to the skies
The silent fields no peasant nears,
The simple epitaphâ€”a tear
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
The sneers of critics superfine;
The snow descends and buries all,
The snows from off the hills around
The snow upon the streets doth meltâ€”
The solstice of our earthly years,
The sorrows of a single state.
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
The starry beacons fade away,
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
The steward sent a note to tell
The stomach doth admonish us.
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
The story of his young loveâ€™s dream,
The story of thy life and fate.
The strange apartment her oppressed:
The strife grew furious and Eugene
The style in which my hero dressed;
The style of wise antiquity.
The sudden rattling of a car.
The sun had mounted high his steep,
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
The table with its lamp unlit,
The tale of these romantic men;
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
The thirst for fame and manâ€™s applause,
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
The time between the wolf and dogsâ€”
The time for mystic strolls which late
The time when Melancholyâ€™s claw
The tiny sun shone less on high
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
The torment born of crime unseen,
The torrent of opinion,
The traveller, bird of passage he,
The trees in silvery array,
The triumph of a conquest new.
The troop of apparitions fled,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
The twilight pale which softens all,
The two friendsâ€™ compliments she hears
The two old ladies then embraced
The unaffected traits she now
The unbidden guests he roughly chidesâ€”
The uncontaminated kiss
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
The venerable dame opined
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
The very morning of our days.
The vestibule finds empty quiteâ€”
The vile seducer shall not dare
The village wherein yawned Eugene
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
The votary of vain delight
The weary way still incomplete,
The wedding-day had been arranged,
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
The windows whitened, shutters closeâ€”
The wind rose instantly, blew out
The witching light of sympathy;
The wit of others to acquire.
The wolf upon the highways bold
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
The wood she entersâ€”bear behind,â€”
The woods, still naked to the view,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
The words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
The workpeople she superintended,
The works of Mr. Richardson.
The world enough. Congratulate
The world is ever altering!
They are all natural and low,
They blossom, ripen and they fall
They crack a feeble joke and smileâ€”
They deem her somewhat finical,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
They first of all my brow did wreathe
They growl a bitâ€”they scandaliseâ€”
They hand in hand to table go.
They have invited you this week.â€
They in a peaceful life preserved
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
They long ago had held debate.
They long at home have her expectedâ€”
They made him feel inclined to doze;
They may forget that we exist.
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
The young Simeonova too there
â€œThe younger, youâ€™re in love with her!â€
The young proprietor we find;
The youthful lover once again
The youthful poetâ€™s fond confession.
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
They sat, but conversationâ€™s flow
They sent their complimentsâ€”but oh!
They shout and no one lists at all.
They shovel silver with a spade,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
They were the wonderful traditions
They will receive us with delight.â€
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
They would not solemnly debate
Thinking: â€™tis foolish to disturb
Thinking to float upon the stream,
This anchorite amid his waste
(This by command; for it was found,
This evanescent boyish bliss.
This gentle daring who could guess?
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
This great discovery relief
This he believed: a kindred spirit
This is my masterâ€™s sitting-room.
(This joking I used to protest),
This life in masquerade concealed,
This lot in life with stern decree?
This monument of thought profound
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
This northern summer of our own,
This was his social character.
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
This world. I do not praise desire,
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Thither in future to proceed
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Thou also, my ideal true,
Thou also, reader generous,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
Though Baratynski verses penned,
Though, God be praised! he neâ€™er designed
Though I confess I hardly dare
Though Iâ€™ll return to him right early,
Though around honoured Priamâ€™s throne
Though beauty he no more adored,
Though by an error and unsoughtâ€”
(Though certainly mankind he knew
Though correspondence as a rule
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
Though for his Helen Menelaus
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Though hitherto a lady neâ€™er
Though late, have a beginning made.
Though now my love might be intense,
Though of romance therein I fail
Though scarcely following what was said,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Though superannuated rather;
Though the foul vision promise made
Though to the Academy I come
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
Though we will not acknowledge it.
Though without palaces and streets,
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Thouâ€™lt quaff loveâ€™s sweet envenomed stream,
Thouâ€™lt suffer, dearest, but before,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
Three mortal hours per diem he
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Thrice happy who their agonies
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
Through dense aristocratic rows
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
Thus age approached, the common doom,
Thus a guest with composure will
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Thus did our friend OnÃ©guine preach:
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
Thus having braved Apolloâ€™s rage
Thus her perversity hath shown.
Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,
Thus in the earth the seed expands
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
Thus oftâ€”this I myself confessâ€”
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
Thus to assassinate the eve?â€â€”
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
Thus we began our little taleâ€”
Thus widely meditation erred,
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!â€
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
Thy meditative incantationâ€”
Till January fell no snowâ€”
Till absently Vladimir took
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
Till mornâ€”life uniform but gay,
Till out of breath upon a seat
Till proper rings could be procured.
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
Till the mazurkaâ€™s close he stays,
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Time-honoured Kremlinâ€™s keys present.
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
Time was, a valiant general might
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Time was, in style magniloquent
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
Time was, the poetâ€™s tender quill
Time was, two maidens from their home
Time was when cold seduction strove
Time will the ravages effaceâ€”
Time without me will lessons give,
Tired by the ballâ€™s incessant noise,
Tiresome unto her hath become
â€™Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
â€™Tis a scene of romance, I vow!â€
â€™Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
â€™Tis day, the family downstairs,
â€™Tis done. To supper they proceed.
â€™Tis dreadfulâ€”ye agree, I hopeâ€”
â€™Tis evidently Heavenâ€™s will
â€™Tis fearful to anticipate
â€™Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
â€œâ€™Tis habit, Lenski.â€â€”â€œIs your ill
â€™Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
â€™Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
â€™Tis noisome to her there: in thought
â€™Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
â€™Tis now the hillock now the rill
â€™Tis now the season! Idlers all,
â€™Tis silent all! Alone the cries
â€™Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
â€™Tis silentâ€”on her shines the moonâ€”
â€™Tis something of this sort I deem.
â€™Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
â€™Tis there that arrant fops display
â€™Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
â€™Tis time for supper, now for bed,
â€œâ€™Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
â€™Tis time she to the altar went!
â€œâ€™Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
â€™Tis time to marry her, â€™tis true,
â€™Tis time to quit this weary shore
â€™Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_â€
Titles and ages intermixed.
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
To Eve the universal mother,
To God eternal hymns of praise.
To Love all ages lowly bend,
â€œToâ€”?â€â€”â€œLÃ rina.â€â€”â€œTattiana?â€â€”â€œSo.
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
To Olga frequently he would
To Russ indigenous are not;
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
To accompany him and to escort
To agitate me in my dreams.
To all good neighboursâ€™ sport conduced.
To all she answers cruellyâ€”
To an assemblyâ€”she appeared
To anticipate the break of day,
To arid selfishness resigned,
To array himself in evening dress.
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
To ask her name the trouble took.
To a surrender gave consent,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
To banish far unworthy themes
To be a charming mystery:
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
To bring behind: the triple steeds
To captivate her how devoted!
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
To clank the spur, delight the fairâ€”
To classicism Iâ€™ve homage paid,
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
To consanguineous dinners they
To cool the cutletsâ€™ seething grease,
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
To-day it is my turn to teach.
To-day it is my turn to teach.
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
To dire contentment shall give birth
To dominate her worthy lord,
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
To dream upon the sunny strand
To end with him her path below.
To fawn upon and love express;
To find in gossip such delight,
To flight before her radiant look,
To foreign lands he would allude,
To freeze his finger hath begun,
To friendship making no pretence,
Together moments one or two
Together they returned, nor word
Together we have wandered oâ€™er
To guess how you the eve pull through.â€â€”
To happiness contributing.
To help her to the other shore
To her an elegy composed.
To his Penates now returned,
To idle musing was a prey;
To jest as he had done last eve,
To kiss the feet which I admired!
To labour in his sledge forgot,
To lawless love I should preferâ€”
To lawless love I should preferâ€”
To lay two covers secretly.
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
To light had brought them from their dust,
To listen to the rippling rill.
To loiter there in idleness
To look on life as on a show,
To make wise men the idiot play
To male acquaintances he bows,
To many a noisy feast and fight,
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
To me he would his Olga give,
To mention the foregoing eve,
Tome of â€œMalvina,â€ and but three
To-morrow Tania we will show,
To-morrow before break of day,
To-morrow just like yesterday.
â€œTo-morrowâ€™s dawn will glimmer gray,
To move in fashionable life,
To move in fashionable life,
To mutter her concealed desire
To my old nurse alone peruse,
Took aimâ€”but as immediately
Too much Iâ€™m given to intersperse,
To our Tattiana conquering,
To part in amity with thee!
To pass the night at home hath gone.
To pass with reasonable men
To peer into the future tries.
To purest love he tuned his note
To raise a clamour and a din:
To raise his pistol to his eye,
To romp and play she neâ€™er would go:
Torquato Tassoâ€™s strains I deem.
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
To russify the foreign phrase
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
To see aughtâ€”never mind meanwhile)
To see his Olga ere the frayâ€”
To seek him out with bended head.
To shallow sentiment a slave!
To sigh and meditate alone:
To sketch myself that I have tried
To sketch ye in Albanoâ€™s style.
To slay himself with blade or ball,
To standards in which we believe?
To stay the maid against her will.
To strike imagination serve.
To suchâ€”delightful to repel.
To swagger as the art of love,
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
To take a hand at whist oft come:
To take this letter to Oâ€” Well!
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
To the assembly her they bear.
To the fair object of his dream,
To the impressions of our youth,
To the pianoforte he moves
To the sarcastic observation,
To the theatre he repairs
To the young girl he said adieu,
To the youth Eugene hurried nowâ€”
To this arrangement can be seen,
To thy decree my will I bend.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
To treat the matter as a jest,
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
To understand by slow degrees
To vary for a few brief days.
To visit Moscow in the season.
To visit, lovely maid, return,
To wander through the meadows still,
To whom amongst the jealous throng
To whom are our misfortunes grief
â€œTo whom is it to go, my sweet?
To whom we used to consecrate
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
To whom your hearts were consecrate,â€”
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
To write his forefathers to warn
To write in cantos twenty-five.
To write of any other elf
To youthful Olgaâ€™s beauty bright,
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
Transfixed OnÃ©guine mine doth stay.
Transparent oâ€™er the Neva beamed
Transported to our Russian clime.
Trembles at artificial shame.
Trembles upon my lips from spite,â€”
Trembling he seeks the young princessâ€”
Triquet arose, and for the bard
Triumphant by anticipation,
Triumphant with the answer come.
Triumphsâ€”their own or those of friendsâ€”
Troyâ€™s sages should in concert own
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Turned and replied as it behoved,
Turned to her and discordantly
â€™Twas built, the venerable pile,
â€™Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
â€™Twas eve. â€™Twas dusk. The river speeds
â€™Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
â€™Twas not the first time, I can tell
â€™Twas plainâ€”an oaken floor ye scan,
â€œâ€™Twas possible then, happinessâ€”
â€™Twas she who first within his breast
â€™Twas then he loved the tangled grove
â€™Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
â€™Twas these he read and these alone
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
Two dressed in uniform appearâ€”
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
Two hearts perchance were desolate
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
Two poles together glued by ice,
â€™Twould serve ye in an epigramâ€”
Two verses he could recollect
Undeviating and insane
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Undressed herself and went to bed
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Unfavourable unto her.
Unhappily too salt by far;
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Unknown to all he doth appear,
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Until her heart less high should boundâ€”
Until her powers of running fail.
Until the sleepless BrÃ©guet chime
Unto Anicia for the keys
Unto a carping world must showâ€”
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
Unto her husband, went awayâ€”
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Unto his own Tattiana he,
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tellâ€”
Unto the fields she makes her way,
Unto the gates the servants fly
Unto the hero of this lay
Unto their solitude one day,
Unto the sounding sea to list,
Unto the windmill he must ride
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?â€”
Upon her brow sits wrath aloneâ€”
Upon her cheek by adulation
Upon her elbow she reclines,
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
Upon his couch insensibly;
Upon its damp opacity,
Upon my lake I love to float,
Upon my visions such intrude.
Upon the Donâ€™s broad pastures bred
Upon the ball-roomâ€™s glassy floor
Upon the dreary northern snows,
Upon the earth a mist did lie
Upon the highway of the sea
Upon the meadows showering,
Upon the opening page ye find:
Upon the stage his weary glance.
Upon the table in a trice
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Upon the windows tracery,
Upon those margins she perceived
Upon those pages she descries
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
Up to the attic, and all need
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
Urging your droshkies swift as air
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
Us from the world wherein we live.
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Variety of speech and vests,
Verses and tears et cetera.
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Vice in romance is glorified
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
Villages in the distance show
Virgins miraculous I see,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
â€œ_Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
Vladimir Lenski visited
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
Vladimir closes up his book,
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
Vladimir something curtly said
Vladimirâ€™s property, a man
Vociferously paid her court,
Voices and hands applaud, and she
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Vows matrimonial to break,
Wafted upon poetic wing,
Waiting his comingâ€”his alone!
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
Wallow, my friends, in company!
â€œWarm yourself here a little space!â€
Was a delightful little spot,
Was born beside the Neva, where
Was certainly no Grandison.
Was certainly not erudite
Was drawn, ideal of my layâ€”
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Was he in health and void of care?â€”
Was it not so?â€”for thee I gave,
Was nothing but the British spleen
Was not surprised thereby at all.
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
Was that which we are wont to call
Was the first question Olga made,
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Was the old and forgotten coach;
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Was uttered, and the cabin shookâ€”
Was withered ere the morning lightâ€”
Was with himself dissatisfied.
Was wont with me at cards to play.
Was worthy of that old baboon,
Was younger than myself, my light,
We Russians, friends from distant parts
We all of us of education
We are the first who such a name
Wearied of leisure in the end,
We called to mind our youthful daysâ€”
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
We glide along a floor of wax.
We hear with interest intense
â€œWell!â€â€”â€œI the elder should prefer,
Well! LÃ rina appears to us
Well, if your pistol ball by chance
Well! just as she was yesterday.
Well known unto OnÃ©guine mine.
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
We must admit but little taste
â€œWe never loved in days of old,
Were I like you a bard by tradeâ€”
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
Were to analysis subjected.
Were you in love when you were young?â€â€”
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
We visit about Christmas Day,
â€œWhat! Grandison?â€â€”â€œYes, certainly!â€
What I by relatives conceive?
What agitation languidly
â€œWhat ails thee?â€â€”â€œNothing.â€â€”He is fled.
â€œWhat ails thee, dear?â€â€”â€œI feel depressed.
What are they? Gladly would I yield
What a storm of emotions keen
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
What boots it with the age to strive?
â€œWhat can be done? She is no child!â€
â€œWhat can be drearier than the house,
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
What doth she see? Around the board
What everybody long has known;
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
What, invitations? The same day
What is his latest character?
What is thy cleverness to me?
â€œWhat is your name?â€ The boor looked dazed,
What jokes and guesses now abound,
What languor would his silence show,
What moreâ€™s required? The world replies,
What never was remarked or heard
What once I knew is clean forgotâ€”
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
What! really going? â€™Tis too bad!
What sad emotions oâ€™er me steal
What say you? to the familyâ€”
What they in conversation said?â€”
What visions then her fancy throngedâ€”
What visions then her fancy throngedâ€”
What will the coming dawn reveal?
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
When I yon semicircle bright
When Passionâ€™s fire no longer glows
When all around the entrance pressed,
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
When but a boy he Olga loved
When captured in a schoolboyâ€™s cap;
When deaf and silent he doth lie
Wheneâ€™er a brilliant courtly dame
Wheneâ€™er across the plain at speed
Wheneâ€™er he had an aching head;
When evening oâ€™er the landscape looms,
When first upon my cheek I feel
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
When he in ardent verse portrays
When hopeâ€™s delightful flower but bloomed
When in as instant she is lost,â€”
When in her walks abroad she met
When in simplicity ye wrote
When in that company she saw
When in the grand saloon was heard
When in the studyâ€™s calm retreat,
When motionless your gaze beneath
When oâ€™er a glass with friends we prate
When on the pallid eastern sky
When people with long countenance
When poets lachrymose recite
When separationâ€™s hour drew nigh,
When shall I wing my passage free
When, sitting by his fire alone
When tea was brought. â€™Tis my delight
When that time comes, a poem Iâ€™ll strive
When the hour came to bid good-byeâ€”
When the mazurka used to peal,
When the obedient doll in sport
When the same life before him lies
When the sonorous BrÃ©guet tells
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
When, where, and in what desert land,
When will my hour of freedom come!
When will the devil take his own!â€
When, wise at length, we seek repose
When youthâ€™s rebellious hour drew near
Where God alone knows whom she met.
Where I can no more recollect?â€”
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
Whereâ€”â€â€”â€œWhat! another eclogue spin?
Where all upon the surface lies,â€”
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Where dwelt the Musesâ€™ worshipper,
Where each young critic ready stands,
Where every day before his eyes
Where fashionable circles meet
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Wherefore am I your quarry held?â€”
Wherefore am I your quarry held?â€”
Wherefore regarding him express
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
Wherein I buried left my heart.
Wherein I castigation get;
Wherein I felt loveâ€™s fatal dart,
Wherein a space OnÃ©guine spent.
Wherein love innocently pines.
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
Wherein the miserable wife
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Where is OnÃ©guine? Half asleep,
Where is he who doth not deceive?
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
Where long time he in solitude
Where many another hand had signed
Where melancholy rocks arise
Where my days in the wilderness
Where plentifully feelings flow
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
Where the first time I saw your face,â€”
Where the first time she met with _him_.
Whereto in language courteous
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Which afterwards the muse revived.
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Which from the devilâ€™s bookcase start,
Which glowed with virginal desire.
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
Which in the elevated sphere
Which in the winter were a joy:
Which in your spirit dominates,
Which is he? or an imitation,
Which lessons unto us repeat,
Which might for many ages last.
Which â€™neath her pillow lay till morn.
Which never have existed, eâ€™en
Which oâ€™er the waters boldly leap,
Which of approaching labour tells
Which rankled in Tattianaâ€™s breast,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Which shines with iridescent hues.
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
Which we experienced long ago.
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
Whilst from her countenance neâ€™er stirred
Whilst he â€œbelle Ninaâ€ had the face
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
Whilst the fond parents, friends throâ€™ life,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Whither along them doth he pelt?
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Whither at headlong speed doth go
â€œWhither away? Deuce take the bard!â€â€”
Whither departed is the host?
Whither shall he go first? Heâ€™ll see,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
Whither that evening he will go.
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
â€œWho? Is it that stout general, pray?â€â€”
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
Who by a haughty word or glance
Who cannot conjure former joys?
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
Who early died a gallant death_,â€
Who every gesture, every phrase
Who floats contentedly through life,
Who following Petrarch move along
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Who had for four long years survived
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Who in the agony of grief
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
_Who in thy love finds more delight
Who knows? with loveâ€™s consuming flame
Who labours hard to humour us?
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Whom, as the custom is of men,
Whom autocratic fateâ€™s decrees
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
Whom latterly one often meets
Whom pale Dianaâ€™s ray illumesâ€”
Whom thirty centuries adore.
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Whom you in slumber may have seen.â€
Who now could fail to recognize
Who now could fail to recognize
Who reads his visionary theme
Whose author nature understood
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
Whose hands indulgently caress
Whose heart experience icy made
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
Whose memory doth not refuse
Whose qualities appeared to afford
Whose tones Apolloâ€™s sons inspire,
Who the romance do not complete,
Who the romance do not complete,
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
Who thrives this moment as I write,
Who to surrender did not blench
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
â€œWho will be there?â€â€”â€œThe family.
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Who without more prevarication
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?â€â€”
Who words and actions will adjust
â€œWho would have thought it? As of yore!
Who would the maiden innocent
â€œWhy, as God ordered! My Ivan
â€œWhy did you leave last night so soon?â€
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?â€”
Will be absorbed by Letheâ€™s stream;
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
Will he pursue?â€”But no one came.
Will not five centuries exceed
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
Will pass; the same to-morrow tryâ€”
Will teach grammatical conceits,
Will to the old times faithful be.
Will you?â€â€”â€œAgreed.â€â€”â€œI thank you, friend,â€
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
Winter resigned her empire white,
Winterâ€™s approach she doth not hail
With Eugene pranks of former years
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
With Olga; nor of this appeared
With Ozeroff was wont to share
With affectation,â€”nothing more.
With all dissatisfaction shows.
With all their progeny were there,
With an imagination wild,
With ardent sighs and flattery
With bated breath, around she bends
With better half as cumbersome;
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
With blessings on the ditches and
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
With book in hand reclined in bed,
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
With clouded brow stands silently?
With deeper woe than othersâ€™ grief.
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
With epigrams impertinent,
With eye precise and without fail.
With fir-trees standing motionless
With flame more ardent passion burns,
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
With gay design and silken stitch.
With great delight.â€”O God on high!
With her they did associate,
With him were friends eternally:
With his exasperated sense,
With his ferocious mate appears.
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
With hope and then perplexity,
With hopeless passion: from her bed
With humble prose Iâ€™ll fill my page
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
With inexact pronunciation
Within her; she is sick at heart;
Within his memory there lay,
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
Within its wave the sounding pail,
Within my memory I bore
Within resounded shriek and shout:
With intellect and strong volition
With intellect, a taste refined,
Within that secret court discussed,
With iridescent wing doth flap
With it may be a couple more;
With its exhilarating flow,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
With jealous fire resuscitate,
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
With laughter smothered weariness:
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
With little knowledge and that wrong
With loud explosion, the bright wine
With loversâ€™ rubbish filled, was neat
With love which happiness extends;
With many a snare their pathway line!
With many a vacancy, â€™tis said.â€â€”
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
With measured step and even gait
With mute appeal to ask they seemâ€”
With one foot resting on its tip
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
With our OnÃ©guine doth aspire
Without a chance to slip away.
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Without constraint in conversation
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Without disgust we look upon?
Without enthusiasm he met
Without grammatical mistakes.
Without participation hears,
Without profession, business, wife,
Without the faintest trace to leave
Without the ken of parents both,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Without them Eugene is complete;
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
With pungent or obtuse retort,
With purple hand Aurora leads,
With quite a lachrymose expression
With rapturous longing he awaits,
With roses, caps and looks malign;
With sad refrain misfortune near.
With satisfaction marvellous,
With scandalâ€™s trivial ornament.
With serious air then went away
With smiling face he Lenski hears;
With so much warmth and intellect?
With spiritual tenderness;
With such a perversity proclaim.
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
With taffety instead of crape.
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,â€”
With tears which secret sufferers loveâ€”
With tenderness hath recognized
With the â€œWell-Wisherâ€ in her hand!
With the epistle of my fair;
With this immoderate request
With this unpleasant _tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte_,
With thoughts of a far distant land,
With tranquil air OnÃ©guine leads
With tumult or contentment still
With unanimity complete,
With us is easily attained.
With us â€™tis quite a novelty
With â€œvaleâ€ finish off a note;
With what avidity and zest
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
With words of foreign origin
With worldly honours, it may be,
Would agitate a mystic wreath
Would at the proper time appear.
Would haste in agitation dire
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Would she in silence long remain.
Would she the canvas tight enrich
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
Would whisper: shall I so long live?â€â€”
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Writ in my honour now and thenâ€”
Yawning betook him to a pen.
Yea! although rendered beauteous
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
Ye billows of blue Hadriaâ€™s sea,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Ye feel but little interest,
Ye golden days of my young spring?
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Ye men of fashion cynical,
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
Ye mothers also, caution use,
Ye need dissimulation base
â€œYe peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
Yes! every one must have his foes,
Yes! for our unpretending home,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
Yes, happyâ€”though she at his side
Yet as a rule their talk I call
Yet clearer shines than every light
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
Yet let us part in friendship, O
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
Yet on a frosty winter day
Yet satiated with success,
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
Yet sometimes pages two or three
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Yet still apparently aspire
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
Yet still remains the old despair.
Yet suffering emotional
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
Yet was her inmost soul oâ€™erjoyed
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Yon silly moon upon the brink
You choose.â€â€”â€œBut who is she?â€â€”â€œMy wife.â€
You fall in love again. But stillâ€”
â€œYou have a letter to me sent.
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
You know that I am now a foolâ€”
Youâ€™ll find her portrait there, I vouch;
Youâ€™ll spend your winter famously!
You never since your nose have shown.
Young ladiesâ€™ faces and their feet.
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
You oâ€™er your wine insulted hathâ€”
Your conversation cold and hard,
Your conversation cold and hard,
â€œYour fashionable world I hate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Your innocent and charming note
Your magic voices I shall greet,
â€œYour second you have left behind!â€
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
Youth freshens beneath Passionâ€™s showers,
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
Zaretski shouted: â€œWhy, heâ€™s killed!â€â€”
Zaretski, village mechanician,
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
and with dishevelled hair,

A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
A Russian household simple quite,
A Russian in Childe Haroldâ€™s cloak,
A Russian poemâ€™s mechanism
A Vampire fond of meditation,
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
A ball here, there a childrenâ€™s treat,
A ball in Peterâ€™s capital,
Abandon cities riotous,
Abandoned he his country seat,
â€œAbandon hope for ever here!â€
Abandoning insane delight,
A bastard fame prohibited?
A bastard fame prohibited?
A bearded postillion astride
A beau is for Tattiana found!
A beauty languidly at rest,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
A book at early morn perused.
A bottle of a vintage white
About the crop of hay, the wine,
About the rain and flax and cattle.â€â€”
Above the ashes of the dead.
Above the humble urn of death.
Above the yawning grave would fight,â€”
A box of terrible import.
A breathless silence then, prolongedâ€”
A breathless silence then, prolongedâ€”
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
Absorbed in melancholy mood
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
A canine face with horns thereon,
A careless looker-on estranged
A case of books he doth obtainâ€”
Accelerates her hasty pace,
Accents of rapture or despair
A certain little escapade
A charm with it in conversation.
A child devoid of childishness
A constant harping on one tune,
A coquette loves by calculation,
A countenance perplexed and scared.
A country damselâ€™s album trim,
Acquaintance instantly to make.
A crab upon a spider rides,
A critic of the stage malicious,
Across her youth a shade had come,
Across the Balticâ€™s salt sea waves,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
Across the smiling face of dawn.
Across the stage still madly sweep,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
A curious interest disclose
A dagger, asterisk, or note
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
Adieu she to the matron said
â€œAdieu! thou home where peace abides,
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
Adieu! whateâ€™er thou didst desire
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A door he opens. But why shrank
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Adorned with many a vision bright
A double force unto their song
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
Adroitly seized and carried her;
A duellist of classic mind,
A due which must to earth be paid.
â€œAdvance!â€â€” Indifferent and sedate,
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
A dying man with art to soothe,
A faithful model she appeared
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
A feeble version read below,
A few of different temper deemed,
_Affectionately yours till death_.
Affection how did you requite?
Affection how did you requite?
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
A finished madrigal would frame
A first success light pinions gave,
A flimsy trace of musings past
A fop, in dress pedantical.
A forest now she sees in front
A fragile bridge and insecure,
A friar black approaching near,
A friendly hand thy life hath taâ€™en!
After the wedded couple strain;
Again a century should scourge
Again her rural life she sought,
Again imagination blazed,
Again in her ethereal dance?
Against my inclination, friends,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
Again the plague of boyhoodâ€”love?
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A game of chess would often play,
A garden by a shining rill.
Age immature averse to cheatâ€”
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
A gust of passion never tore
Ah! Iâ€™m so weakâ€”my throbbing breast!
Ah! I still struggle to forget
A hand of ice appeared to seize
A happy destiny ordained:
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
â€œAh! come, Tattiana, come to me!
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
A hermitâ€™s life OnÃ©guine led,
Ah! he has gone the other wayâ€â€”
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
A hidden meaning could impart,
A hidden train of wild desire.
Ah! it may be, affection true
â€œAh! long the world hath missed thy shape!
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
â€œAh! nurse, a favour do for me!â€â€”
A horseâ€™s hoofs she hearsâ€”She shrinks!
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
A hundred times will not repeat,
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
A jolly song and distant horn;
A joyous troop of little boys
A kerchief round her silver hair
Akulka who was once Celine,
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
â€œAlack! Tattiana,â€ she replied,
A lady draws the hostess near,
A ladyâ€™s hand doth never kiss.
A lancer captivates her heart!
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Alarm the winter journey gave.
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
â€œAlas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
Alas! for now before her passed
Alas! he loved as in our times
Alas! how wretched now my lot!â€
Alas! lifeâ€™s hours which swiftly fly
â€œAlas! my friend, no revenue!â€
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
Alas! my stomach it betrays
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Alas! the friend of childish days
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
Albums magnificent which scare
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
A letter for her hero meant:
A life in common with the rest;
A life of fact, not fiction, ledâ€”
Alike by sighs and flattery.
A little Juvenal to spout,
A little farther please to read
A little virgin mirror peeps.
All Nature winter seemed to await,
All about Olgaâ€”to a light
All are amazed; but Lenski he
All are constrained and fetters bear,
All arise. To the door he goes.
All breathless and without replies.
All bustle when he makes a sign:
All covered up with snow in heaps,
All dark and silent hath become;
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
All in the good old style appears,
All mothers their sweet girls believed
All overtures of friendship ended.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
All silently hung down his head.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
All so distinct, and all so white!
All sons of mental weariness.
All that a poet could desire,
All that industrial London brings
All that perfection could desire;
All the creations which below
All the young people round about,
All this I know is out of date,
All this in many cases brings
All this, my friends, translate aright:
All this was novel to Eugene.
All to the doctors Eugene send,
All to the grand saloon are goneâ€”
All vanished as an echo goes.
All visited him at first, of course;
All which caprice and affluence craves,
All which in Paris eager taste,
All with urbanity betray,
Almost became a poet sayâ€”
A loaded pistol in his hand.
A load of care upon the maid.
Alone amid possessions great,
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Alone within his habitation
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Along Saint Petersburgâ€™s paved streets,
Along the Nevaâ€™s bank he sleighs,
Along the hall, and high above
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
A loverâ€™s letter might convey,
A love which knew no limitation,
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
Already by repentance moved
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Already dance to song proceeds;
Already he grew phthisical.
Already sings the nightingale.
Also one ViÃ¡zemski, remarking
Also their feetâ€”yet neâ€™ertheless
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
Also, to equalise the scales,
Although her book did not contain
Although it will not bear translation,
Although the destined coffin nears,
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
Although we know that Eugene had
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Always together, eventide
Am I to go through the whole list?â€
A maidenâ€™s secretsâ€”of the heart.
A maid hath oft, may yet again
A mansionâ€”by the window, see!
A marriageable maid matured,
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
Amid a serious disputation,
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Amid sly, pusillanimous
Amidst successes flattering
Amid submissive herds of men
Amid the awful emptiness
Amid the company career.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Amid the soulless sons of pride
A mien unaltered she preserved,
A mild quotation to translate,
A million bipeds reckons thus
A modern Regulus unchained,
A moment effervescing stirs,
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
An almanac but eight years old.
An ancient lady full of grace.â€”
An ardent heart and yet so mild?â€”
And â€œAgathonâ€ replied, amazed.
And Christian folk will, I expect,
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
And Eugene ever in her soul
And Eugene soon discovered there
And FliÃ noff, pensioned councillor,
And FliÃ noff, somewhat indisposed,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
And I admired their common sense
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
And I confess that now-a-days
And I discerned through Fancyâ€™s prism
And I, remembering Svetlana,
And I to give thee cakes was wont?â€â€”
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
And Lenski followedâ€”a light brokeâ€”
And Limburg cheese alive and old
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
And Schiller read by candlelight.
And Taniaâ€™s husband soon appeared.â€”
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
And about dawn upon his breast
And a boy handed round the cream.
And a determined disposition,
And after Albionâ€™s proud lyre
And after them at headlong pace
And agitate my heart again;
And a grand festival proceeds.
And a guitar produced we see,
And a half rubles down gave she;
And aimless journeys did commenceâ€”
And all in snow is buried deep.
And all that from thy hand proceedsâ€”
And all the joys which Winter knows.
And all the three to breakfast went;
And all thy precious elegies,
And all with one accord agreed,
And all without her husbandâ€™s leave.
And all your love on self bestow;
And a long time about her talked.
And alphabetically tries
And also fashionable beaux.
And also that my feeble verseâ€”
And a malicious epigram
And ancient usages observed
And an elegiac poem wrote.
And an enchanting shoulder shines
And an encouragement did breathe
And a new diadem supplied.
And an habitual sense of pain;
And an old gent the poet marking
And a romance in ancient style
And as a country damsel roved,
And at economy was great;
And at the altar of their fame
And at the stages bugs and fleas
And at the table sat her down.
And barely visible the smoke
And be as happyâ€”as I might.
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
And beckon to the passing sails.
And bends her mirror on the moon,
And be not in advance severe.
And better, if I judge aright;
And better, if I judge aright;
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
And bless mankind with full delight.
And blest me, sinking to the grave.
And blest the shadows of the night.
And blush to own himself reflect.
And boiling oâ€™er with friendly heat,
And both of dull existence tired,
And breathe a drama in his ear.
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
And brooding oâ€™er the ills he bore,
And buried deep in meditation,
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a sweet delusion he
And by degrees upon him grew
And by that shady rivulet
And by the fiddleâ€™s rushing sound
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
And, by the way, I here assert
And by the world repeated oft,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
And can it be? But late a child
And cannot anything conceal,
And care but little for its ends.
And cares not farther to proceed;
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
And clad in airy costume took
And comfort of each country dame,
And consolation soon begot.
And contemplative dreaminess;
And cool sagacious mind he had:
And courtier, fop, and usurer
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
And cry: he was a poet great!
And dames of fine organisations,
And dark and drear the evenings were,
And death before the husband wide
And deem the world perfection is!
And devastate the woods around.
And disappear in space; then she
And distance interposed in vain,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
And dost thou know her?â€â€”â€œWe live near.â€
And dream of lifeâ€™s delightful dawn?
And due precautions take betimes.
And ease and fashionable waste,â€”
And ease the tortures of the heartâ€”
And education runs to waste,
And (elbows on the table) they
And endless the cotillon seemed
And enmity and hope and loveâ€”
And every morning I awake
And every year distributed
And exclamations and good cheer.
And exclamations interlaced.
And eye which gleams with inspirationâ€”
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
And far removed from rumour vain;
And far removed from rumour vain;
And fashionable magazines,
And fashionâ€™s gay frivolities;
And female tears hysterical,
And fields my joys have ever been;
And finally he deigns let fall
And finally, upon his bed
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
And fled afarâ€”she followed me.
And flooded all the level ground.
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And following them ye might espy
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
And for a time our course delay,
And form a network left and right;
And freezing fits of weariness.
And from his dressing-room would pass
And from the Millionaya afar
And from the country all around
And from the misty woodland nigh
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
And full of innocent delight,
And gallicisms I love as well
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
And gallops to her house away.
And gave himself but little pain
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
And glasses unemployed all night;
And glittering simpletons beside;
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
And gossip of the town and fashion
And gradually day unfolds.
And grant his weary bones their rest
And grant success to labour long;
And grasp a stirrup fortunateâ€”
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
And grown more curious by far
And had with waddling in the end
And handsome countenance combined,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
And harmony was soon restored.
And hastened to his uncleâ€™s side,
And hated casual visitors,
And hates the worldâ€™s discordant ways.
And hat surnamed a â€œBolivarâ€
And heard a voice cryâ€”_Why! Heâ€™s killed!_â€”
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
â€œAnd heâ€”but of him presentlyâ€”
And heedless of approval seems,
And he had made her heart beat quick!
And her bespangled robe doth wave
And herds of oxen wandering low;
And her upon the threshold laid.
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
And his poor basten sandal knits.
And his strange conduct at the dance
And homeward like an arrow tore.
And honestly â€™tis my belief
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
And hot with jealous indignation,
And hurried home his awful freight.
And husbandsâ€™ tedious amity?
And if Tattiana mine had foundâ€”
And impiously should declare,
And in addition youth is flame
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
And in a whisper did repeat:
And in her conversation drawled.
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
And in her hand a French romance.
And in her languid bosom raise
And in her native language she
And in reality one day
And in society might shed
And in society might shed
And, inspiration firing me,
And in the Summer Garden rove.
And in the bathroom did command
And in the final tome we learnt,
And in the frosty night alone
And in the morning doth not know
And irrigate them with champagne;
And irritates the appetite.
And is all light within destroyed?
â€œAnd is it long since back he came?
â€œAnd is it,â€ meditates Eugene.
â€œAnd is it she? It must beâ€”noâ€”
And is it true and not a jest,
And is it true her garland bright
And isolated from all men,
And it may be a secret dread
And jests doth recapitulate.
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
And, joy of souls effeminate,
And judgment which unsteady veers
And kindness Tania was impressed,
And leads a solitary life?
And leaning â€™gainst the portal closed
And leans upon the monsterâ€™s arm,
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And led me off to church with song.â€
And lessons to his children read.
And life and fate in turn selected
And like Childe Harold gloomily
And like Napoleons each of us
And like a palisade flit by.
And like a shadow haunted her.
And like his shadow dogged his life,
And like the prisonerâ€™s our delight
And linen on him doth bestow.
And lo! five paces more they pass,
And lo! he is already there!
And lonely through the forest creeps.â€
And long her eyes as through a haze
And long internal agitation
And long perukes hath vanishÃ¨d.
And loveâ€™s delicious diadem
And loves you asâ€”a relative!
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
And madrigals Iâ€™m asked to write!
And make a dark existence shine
And many a caravan on high
And many a day thereafter laid
And many another slily sneered;
And marking Taniaâ€™s agitation,
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
And may fall headlong any time.
And meditative from the spot
And meditative homeward goes,
And mental elasticity.
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
And more imagination teems.
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
And my Eugene the path must traceâ€”
And my Tattiana now began
And my dark soul to light was brought;
And my romanceâ€™s open theme
And naked uniformity.
And natural benevolence,
And necessary fools allowed.
And never hath our language proud
And never was the ear affright
And no ridiculous report,
And not a speck of dirt descried.
And nothing more important sees;
And now, I mournfully confess,
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
And now he views forgotten foes,
And now his youthful heart desires
And now philanthropy his soul,
And now she skips and now she springs
And now â€™tis night, the guardian moon
And now upon the snow in thaw
And now we hear delightedly
And numerous pages had preserved
And oâ€™er the granite coping bent,
And oft at eventide a throng
And of the attic. Honestly,
And of the irksome harness tires,
And oft in whispers would impart
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
And oh! what verses, what delights,
And on the footstool sitting down
And on the last one, underlined:
And others rise ephemeral!
And ought he not to disregard
And our successors soon shall drive
And our swift troikas never tire;
And overcome antipathies
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
And past the threshold of decay,
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
And physic bring with mournful face,
And platitudes and pedantry,
And pleasureâ€™s daily blandishment,
And pressed her handâ€”the crimson blush
And privileges nice allowed,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
And reads with rapid eager eye
And rest from bygone days of strife.
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
And rising from her bench proceeds;
And roofs near morn blanched oâ€™er with snow;
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
And sallied forth one brilliant mornâ€”
And satisfied with vengeance taâ€™en.
And saying this Vladimir drained
And scanned in silence its content.
And secretly their views expound.
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
And sermonâ€”but in that dread hour
And sermonâ€”but in that dread hour
And shall adopt some new caprice.
And she at last hath us deceived;
And she despite herself would waste
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
And shorter had the days become.
And showed with an uncertain light
And shut him in a lonely nook.
And silent as the maid Svetlana
And since I pulled thee by the earâ€”
And slowly life coagulatesâ€”
And soâ€”God bless them, if He list.
And so Tattiana was her name,
And so departed. But Eugene,
And solitude and calm delight.
And solitude and calm delight,
And sometimes into snares as well
And so my noon hath come! If so,
And soon Lel hovered oâ€™er her head.
And soon OnÃ©guineâ€™s door beside
And soon imagination threw
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
And spectacles, his knitting staid
And spouted it with lyric fireâ€”
And spur my spiritâ€™s torpid mood!
And starting suddenly doth say:
And stay whose length none recollects.
And still the coachmen round the fires
And stoves of various shapes abound.
And straight returning whence he came,
And stupid censors passionate;
And such unconsciously he led,
And sulked in silent indignation;
And supercilious dames she glides,
And supper. In the country we
And swifter than the swallowâ€™s flight.
And tears of reconciliation:
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
And testy gamesters do engage
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And that no longer could inspire.
And that too often we receive
And that unrivalled paragon,
And the SkatÃ¨nines, aged pair,
And the attendants called in haste.
And the bad book accompanies.
And the cast-iron statuette
And the cold beauties of the season:
And the conviction soon arose,
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And the eternal lorgnette through
And the extent of his caprice;
And the fair sex as light as down!
And the far mountains daintily
And the heartâ€™s agitated dreams.
And the kind-hearted servitors:
And the lime alleyâ€™s twilight dim
And the lone secret of her heart,
And the more surely we ensnare
And then a cup of coffee drank,
And the newcomers welcome bade.
And then made merry pope and guest,
And then â€œmonsieurâ€ supplied her place;
And then she soon â€™twixt work and leisure
And then the stanzas of my theme
And then with blind credulity
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
And the recesses of my mind
And the sagacious Triquet back
And the saloon threw open wide;
And these the attentive maid observed
And the suspicious veteran old,
And the world met her smilingly,
And the young damsel from the town,
And the young girl appeared before
And the young ladies fortunes told,
And the young revellers of past times
And they the waters recommend.
And think: here lies who loved me well,
And this fifth canto ought to be
And this the faithful one allows,
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
And though I read it with distress,
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
And though her soul might be confused,
And though perchance a lady may
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.â€
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
And thou, persistent to the end,
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
And thou, youthâ€™s early inspiration,
And through the lofty windows views
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
And thus he never fell among
And thus he spent eight years of time,
And thus in season the rich field
And thus it is â€™twould cause me pain
And thus secures the prey we seek.
And thus unto her nurse did say:
And thy inebriating wave
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
And to OnÃ©guine far away
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
And to the field of honour led;
And to these letters and these tears.
And to these letters and these tears.
And town and friends forgotten quite.
And traces with a slender finger
And triumphs in career erotic.
And true, his pistolâ€™s faultless aim
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
And turned aside the drapery;
And turned to leave immediately,
And two old pines their branches spreadâ€”
And unto whom we all allude
And usually despised it too),
And vanish like a bird in air.
And various chords upon it proves,
And vehemently though amazed
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
And views amongst themselves advance
And visit many a foreign clime,
And vows will probably be signed:
And wakened him with the loud cry:
And watch her eyeâ€™s full glance to meet.
And well-instructed to betray!
And what from its recess appears?
And what like menaces fatigues,
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
And what she from the cards inferred.
And what the old man might bequeath.
And what will Destiny concede?â€
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
And when her violence reviewedâ€”
And when the watery mirror gleamed
And where Thalia softly dreams
And where a madrigal occurs
And where at last his bones repose
And where may be her sister now?
And wheresoeâ€™er thy footsteps err,
And where tempestuous loveâ€™s desires,
And where the admirable streams
And where the billows hoarsely raise
And who is not a tiresome thief?
And wholly occupied his dayâ€”
And who the rent-roll of his race
And wild among them grew her wordsâ€”
And wild festivities among
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
And wisely gallops to the hill.
And wished to say to him farewell.
And with emotional delight
And with gray hair ambrosial
And with his lot in life content,
And with remorseful anguish filled,
And would by candlelight arise.
And yet he in your cause would strive
And yet oblivion forbade.
And yet the cityâ€™s flower was there,
And you, O maids immaculate,
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
An ear to my confession lend;
An ever transcendental flight;
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
A new acquaintance we must scan.
A new proprietor arrived,
Anew the flames of passion start
A new world was made manifest!
An exile from their troublous reign,
An explanation: she was scared,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
An honourable course ye took,
An honourable course ye took,
An hour passed byâ€”anotherâ€”till,
Anicia soon appears, the door
An idle anchorite and sad,
An infant maiden doth exhort
An innate love of meditation,
An inn at every stage erect.
An invalid from lung complaint.
Announcing to him dinner-time.
A noted fop who gambled hard.
Another bard with art divine
Another could her heart engage,
Another could her woe assuage
Another his betrothed was given;
Another passed; â€™twas just the same.
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Another tribune of the ball
Another visit hastes to pay.
Another with cockâ€™s head appeared,
A notoriety proclaimed,
A notoriety proclaimed,
An oval countenance and pink,
A novel in Lafontaineâ€™s style,
Anticipating woe she pined,
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
A pair of bulletsâ€”nought besideâ€”
A pair; though desolate my mind,
A paragon of virtue he!
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
A pensive sorrow in her glance
A philosophic anchorite:
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
Appear; along the road of Tver
Appear attuned to softer chords;
Appeared, Donâ€™s effervescing boast,
Applause, the peopleâ€™s donative.
Approach, approach; I am thine own.â€
Approaches Olga and the pair
A print without the pictureâ€™s grace,
A promenade in twilight late
A prudent man like you and brave
Are admirable, my dear friend,
Are all your relatives quite well?
A register of fleeting thought,
Are not with elegance impressed.
Are oft deceptiveâ€”like their feet.
Are turned upon her. All combine
Are ye replaced by other maids
A riding whip. She strolls along.
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
Arising with the morningâ€™s light,
A rivulet beneath them shoots
Around her neck, now violently
Around my stanzas incomplete
Around the carriage of the pairâ€”
Around the garden homeward hies.
Around the meadow and the grove.
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
Aroused in him some tenderness.
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
Arrange without the least delayâ€”
As Saadi anciently averredâ€”
As Winter in their purity,
As a babeâ€™s slumber, or the light
As a poetic life serene,
As bees who leave their dainty store
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
A scant attendance Lenski showed
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
As cyphers others to appraise,
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
As deaf and silly doth remain,
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
A sense of social delight,
As every journal now entreats,
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
As formerly much agitation.
As formerly the shepherd sits
As giddy youthâ€™s hilarityâ€”
A shape half cat and half a crane.
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
As if against obstruction sore
As if he cruelly had joked!
As if impossible it were
As if it were some funeral feast.
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
As if with eider-down is filled.
A simple tombstone hath been set.
As in a garden when I grew,
As in a thicketâ€™s humble shade,
A single being: â€™twas in fine
As in her heart the thought sank home,
As in some frenzied dream of fear
As in their turn the seasons roll.
As in the timid forest deer,
As it were, tore himself away.
A slave of actresses capricious,
As lordly mansions ought to be,
As many dinners I rehearse,
As many entertainments be!
As men who much had done that day.
A smile from slumbering nature clear
As oft to meat and drink advert,
A something somehow have obtained,
As once, to fill the rapid page
As one who bivouacs afield,
As on the rapid wings of thought
As partner of my mournful days,
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
A sportsman who in covert lies.
As rosy lips without a smile,
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
Assemblies oligarchical
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Assistance ever will extend,
As storms which in chill autumn rage
Assuredly should not have been
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
As the reflection of his age,
As the sins of my youthful days
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
As to a worthy man and good!
A stream, by winterâ€™s ice unbound,
A strong resemblance these possessâ€”
A substitute for lamps we hail!
Asunder was and hate prepared?
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
As when the tempestâ€™s veil is drawn
As with innumerable fires.
As yet none had discovered aught;
As your light footprints on the green.
â€œAt LÃ rinaâ€™s.â€â€”â€œHem, that is queer!
At LÃ rinaâ€™s abode produced
At Russ she was by no means clever
A table to the fire is brought,
At a great feast against desire,
A tangled wilderness around.
At an old auntâ€™s they had arrived
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
At each extreme one takes his stand,
At early morn returns the maid
At eighteen not to play the fool!
A tender couplet he combined,
At eventide would hither come,
At fifty who relief obtained
At first, but soon became inured
At first for books was disinclined,
At first such contradictions wrought
At forty suffered from the gout,
A thick immense neglected grove
At his pale brow a shot to have,
At home arriving he addressed
Athwart the snow four paces cameâ€”
A timid love to banishment?â€”
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
At last became a ruined man.
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
At last my father gave his blessing,
At last the author!â€ cries Mamma.
At least by show of sympathy;
At least their accents and their words
At morn an icy bath within
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
At neighbouring hospitalities.
A tombstone, Aphroditeâ€™s shrine,
At prisonerâ€™s base she never played.
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
A true account and in detail.
At seven in summer rose from bed,
At table she was sitting by
Attend in male attire arrayed.
Attentive be unto my rhymes
Attentive listened to his speech,
Attentive listened to the lad.
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Attentive to the heartâ€™s first beating,
At the front gates, but in brief space
At the same hour she oped her eyes
At thirty who was married well,
At this time almost understood.
At times talk nonsense with design;
At times three words to him addressed
At times to silence would resort,
Attractive in its banefulness?
At twenty who was prig or swell,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
Auroraâ€™s ruddy rays of lightâ€”
Authors replete with sacred fire
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
A valuable hostage gained,
Avenge himself in proper style.
A very troublesome disease,
A victim decked with golden leaves;
A village and beneath, a wood,
A visionary mortified,
A visionary personage
A vision desolate and drear
Avowal then â€™twas time to pray,
Awaiting on the shore I roam
Await the long-delayed caress.
Awakens secret merriment
Away, Tattiana, hath been taâ€™en.
Away! and cease to ring their praise
Away her golden earrings tore;
A weary season was at handâ€”
A while ago the winter spent,
Awhile sound conversation seems
Awhile this beauty captivated,
A whisper runs along the hall,
A white and undulating pall
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
A windmill too a jig performs
A wish from place to place to roam,
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
A worthy object â€™tis, and well
Aye bids ye in some way or otherâ€”
A young Armidaâ€™s lips to press,
A young and handsome galliard.
A young man motionless he saw,
Back to his regiment must roam.
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Balconies, lionâ€™s heads on doors,
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
Bard of the â€œFeasts,â€ and mournful breast,
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Barking, young ladiesâ€™ osculations,
Basins and jugsâ€”well! everything
Bear goneâ€”she at the threshold placed;
Beats that of friends and relatives:
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
Because a member I became.
Because he could not gourmandise
Because her passion wanted art,
Because he yawned at the bare view
Because in singleness of thought
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
Because she was so innocent,
Become alarmed. So never mind!
Bedding is laid out and to all
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
Before a fire which feebly glows
Before he eighteen years attained.
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Before him her wild game of chance.
Before him red roast beef is seen
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Before such fond simplicity
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
Before the dregs they shall divine
Before whom once in solitude,
Before whose inexperienced sight
Begins to talk of this and that,
Behind her a grave general.
Behind, of glasses an array,
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
â€œBehold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrainâ€”â€
Behold! orthography despising,
Behold! than polished floor more nice
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
Behold the dames who once were fine
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Behold! the worldâ€™s opinion!
Being from hell or heaven sent,
Believed, the peopleâ€™s wisdom weird,
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
Beneath her parentsâ€™ eyes the maid
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
Beneath his lipsâ€™ devouring kiss.
Beneath his lipsâ€™ devouring kiss.
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Beneath the sheltering oak treeâ€™s shade
Beneath the silver of the moon
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
Beside a nameless rivulet,
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
Besides, a duellist well-known
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
Beside the stormy sea one day
Beside the thundering abyss
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
Better than Chateaubriand did
Between myself and my Eugene,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Between the stalls, along the toes;
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
Beyond this may attempt to write_.
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
Blest be the labours of the light,
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
Books he abandoned like the fair,
â€œBoredom, my friend, behold the illâ€”â€
Born of a babbler in a loft
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
Both day and night he now must pass
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
Both natural and truthful seemed.
Both were expectant of the hate
Both were of passion satiate
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
BouyÃ noff courted. She refused.
BouyÃ noff too, my cousin, wore
BouyÃ noff whisked off Poustiakova.
BouyÃ noff, wrathful cousin mine,
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
â€œBring dinner now without delay!â€
Bringing his partner corpulent
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Bruin is marching at her back!
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
Buried in meditation deep,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
But Eugene, hating litigation
But Eugene, incontestably,
But Eugene long hath left the press
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But Fortune cast our lots apart
But I abandoned their array,
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
But I am now anotherâ€™s brideâ€”
But I came not to adulate:
But I, in love, was mute and dull.
But I must add to what I write
But I must now employ my Muse
But I perceive thou dost not heedâ€”â€
But I the products of my Muse,
But I was sharp in times gone by.
But Iâ€”what is all this to me?
But Lenski, I should be so glad
But Lenski, having no desire
But Lenski madrigals neâ€™er wrote
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
But Olga would not such peruse.
But, O ye tomes without compare,
But Summer swiftly fades away
But Tania just as in a dream
But Tania neâ€™er displayed a passion
But Taniaâ€™s heart is not at ease,
But, after mutual compliments,
But ah! discerns nor wood nor meadâ€”
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
But, as he never opened them,
But as to fightingâ€”â€™twill appear!
But at a later, sterile age,
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
But better loved the soft repose
But borne in spirit far away
But by degrees the crowd begin
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
But cannot anyhow evade
But cannot stand the northern cold.
But competition I abjure
But contrary to her advice
But could not. Then she questioned him:â€”
â€œBut,â€ cried Zaretski in amaze,
â€œBut death from him will be delight.
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
But enough! Now, â€™tis my intent
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
But even thus not now-a-days!
But fashionable hatredâ€™s flame
But finally grew bored by her.
But finally he oped his eyes
But finally in wedlock bind.
But finally she heaves a sigh,
But finally she softly said:
But finally she softly said:
But first permission did request
But followed the strict rules of art,
But foolsâ€”their calumnies and sneersâ€â€”
But from the Musesâ€™ loftiest height
But from the interview what flowed?
But gazes on OnÃ©guineâ€™s face
But gazes on OnÃ©guineâ€™s face
But grant with magnanimity
But gray Phillippevna the door
But grown familiar side by side
But he desired not to beguile
But, her own room in memory,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
But home his body to despatch
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
But, howsoeâ€™er his lot were cast,
But if the truth I must relate,
But in his heart dissatisfied,
But in the drawing-room all appeared
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
But it grew late; he must not stay;
But kindness from his eye had beamed
But lights incendiary flames
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
But lo! already the moonâ€™s light
â€œBut lo! forth from the valleys dun
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
But look youâ€”ah! do not refuse.â€
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
But man of sense and probity.
But memory like a serpentâ€™s tooth
But merely to exasperate;
But more the passions occupy
â€œBut, _mÃ¡tushka_, to Moscow you
But my OnÃ©guine the whole eve
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
But my Tattianaâ€™s eyes were dry.
But no reply unto her made.
But not at present, though sincerely
But nothing changed in them is seen,
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
But now all doubt was set aside,
But now a question in this wise
But nowhere can she find repose,
But now in her effulgence pale
But now my mind is desolate,
But nowâ€”my very blood congeals,
But nowâ€”my very blood congeals,
But nowâ€”none heeds the monument
But now our hero we must leave
But now our minds are mystified
But now ridiculous a bit.
But nowâ€”what brings you to my feet?â€”
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
But of this love, eâ€™en casually,
But once more pensive and distressed
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
But one thought only filled his mind,
But on the third of grove and mead
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
But praised be God! in health art thou!
But presently she tried to read;
But proudly in his song preserved
But round the hostess scintillate
But sad is the reflection made,
But say he was a genius who
But scarce had maids their saucers taâ€™en
But scarce had sleepâ€™s soft witchery
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
But send your grandson before long.â€
But shall depict the touching scene
But she, her sister never heeding,
But since to the backdoor they led
But sits in bed with air depressed,
But somehow there shone in his look
But soon she altered all her ways,
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
But stares into the darkness deep.
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
But still more stupid did appear
But still remembrance to him clings,
But stop! I will present thee, if
â€œBut strange am I to happiness;
But strength of mind and self-restraint
But such is not my project now,
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
But suddenly all changed around!
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
But sweeter in a midnight dream
But sweeter still it is to arrange
â€œBut tell me, nurse, can you relate
But tell me what am I to do?
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
But that Princess Pauline of old,
But that the eyes of every one
But the dark sepulchre I may
But the date subsequently changed
But the indifferent princess,
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
But the young unpolluted heart
But this adventureâ€™s consequence
But this a heinous crime appeared
But this amusement delicate
But this is my advice, â€™twere best
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
But thoughts meander far awayâ€”
But time flies and she doth forget
But to OnÃ©guine! _A propos!_
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
But, to his uncleâ€™s mansion flown,
But to the garden once again
But trembles, words he cannot find,
But trembling on the mirror dark
But tremor still her frame possessed,
But trusted the ideal she wrought?â€”
But turning morning into night,
But turn we once more to our dame.
But ultimately doth approach.
But upon all that Eugene knew
But was our friend Eugene content,
But were it not immoral I
But what a nuisance it will be,
But what astonished do I find
But what results? His eyes peruse
But, when OnÃ©guineâ€™s turn came round,
But when Tattianaâ€™s hand had taâ€™en
But when the winter season came
But when two minutes she had sat,
But where Melpomene doth rave
But wherefore not?â€”â€™Tis pleasant, nice,
â€œBut which, my dear?â€”In days of yore
But who abandon itâ€”as I
But who abandon itâ€”as I
But who in that choice company
But why are your cheeks whitening?â€
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
But will not modify a tittleâ€”
But with austerity!â€”for you
But with austerity!â€”for you
But with confused and bashful air,
But with her elder sister I
But word for word his letter read.
But would not look at Cicero.
But wretched who anticipates,
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
But you must both be quite tired out!

By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
By Olgaâ€™s hand distributed
By Olga stood, dejected quite
By Providenceâ€™s dark decree!
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
By Tolstoyâ€™s pencil marvellous,
By absence who hath chilled his love,
By an avowal just as plain.
By an _obrokâ€™s_ indulgent rate:
By a rich pie were occupiedâ€”
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
By bee and butterfly which pass.
By â€œbelle Tattianaâ€ to replace.

By computation) it is like
By daily life deteriorated,
By dull insensibility,
By every proper-minded wife,
By flattery and loverâ€™s artâ€”
By fond illusions once possest
By fond illusions once possest
By friendship how they were abused,
By his embarrassed dignityâ€”
By indolence and languor fired
By liberties or loose or light.
By loveâ€™s inevitable flame.
By many a lamp illuminate,
By melancholy fogs concealed.
By neighbouring families bewept,
By night prepared for sorcery,
By other thoughts be occupied.
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
By rank as settled by the State.
By recklessness amuse or shame
Byronâ€™s capricious phantasy
By such allusions scandalous,
By sympathy I have been driven.
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
By the fine silver of the north.
By their own horses, not the postâ€”
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
By the sick ladyâ€™s gaiety
By visions who was neâ€™er deranged
By waters shining tranquilly,
By what idea or observation
By whom the youthful bard was slain?â€â€”
Calling to mind your icy look
Calling to mind your icy look
Callous to all he seemed to be.
Callous to all on earth becomeâ€”
Calm and without embarrassment,
Calmly her eyes encounter hisâ€”
Calmly her eyes encounter hisâ€”
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
â€œCan I inspect the mansion, please?â€
Can count the time without much fussâ€”
Cannot they amicably smile
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
Can she have been a moment gone
Canto the First of this romance.
Can we not stealthily make out
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fÃªtes;
Careless of every social rule,
Careless of fame his spirit high
Caricatures he now designed
Carried a truth divine away;
Carried away by ecstasy,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
Caught him and by the collar took
Ceased for a space all chattering.
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Certainly not Eugene alone
Certain misfortune near opined.
Chained to his bedside night and day
Change of position had essayed,
Charming is your sincerity,
Charming with grave simplicity.
Charms more enduring in the end.
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
China and bronze the tables weight,
Choosing a profitable trade,

Cocked hat and melancholy brow.

Companion of my childhoodâ€™s days.
Compassion now or wrath inspires
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
Confessions which a trusting heart
Confront thy fated torturer!
Congratulations, toasts resound,
Conquer by passion and address,
Conscious of death approximate,
Consisting of harmonious lays,
Constant affection intertwined
Contemplate her sad reverie.
Contemplativeness, her delight,
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
Contented and with victuals stored,
Conventionalityâ€™s dull toolâ€”
Corneilleâ€™s majestic genius,
Corset and album and Pauline,
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Could in romantic mantle drape
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
Could not eclipse her neighbourâ€™s light.
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
Cousin, remembâ€™rest Grandison?â€
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
Crush and confusion in the hall,
Crushing and a confusing noise;
Cunning already to display
Cursing his own stupidity,
Curtly announcing for the fray
Customs by ages sanctified,
Custom the despot soon prevails.
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Dared calmly cleanse his nails â€™fore him,
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
Dark shadows thickenâ€”a dread cry
Dark, unavailing reverie,
Dark was the valley and the wood
Debate commanded ample foodâ€”
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
Deep in our mother Earthâ€™s chill breast!â€
Deep in the distant province rude,
Deep in the greenwood far away?
Deep into debt his father ran;
Deliberate approach of guests
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
â€œDelighted.â€â€”â€œWhen?â€â€”â€œThis very night.
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
Delighted glances in return;
Delighted much his former ways
Demands that I translate for you
_Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
â€œDeparted Lenski here to dine
Departed, ordered out his horse
Depart in peace and friendly live?

Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,

Descends the bank with care extreme,
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
Describe in detail the affair,
Descried before me suddenly!
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
Desire to rule ye may observe
Desirous to annihilate
Despair and anger seize on me,
Despite the anguish of his breast,
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
Detecting him the passing horse
Detest him for a brother slain?
Develops and matures its powers,
Device of rural minds acute!)
Devoured them with an eager zest.
Dianaâ€™s bosom, Floraâ€™s cheeks,
Did not their lips with foreign speech
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
Did they not all the Russian tongue
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
Diminishes as years decline.
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
Discovered much absurdity,
Displayed a noble rectitudeâ€”
Displayed a noble rectitudeâ€”
Distinctly not its mechanism.
Distracted by her grief appears
Divinity without access
Do agitate his late repose.
Do all things which to mirth incline.
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
Do me a favour and appear.
Domestic life attracts me still,
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
Do not excuse yourself. I read
â€œDo notâ€”you mightâ€”suspicious be;
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
Doth in us or our names appear
Doth loveâ€™s incautiousness in her
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
Do we alone our losses mourn
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Drank to her health in the first place,
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall goâ€”
Dreading the worldâ€™s remarks malign,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
Dreaming herself the heroine
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
Dreams with no continuity,
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
Dressed like a London dandy he
Dressing as quickly as he can,
â€œDrive on!â€ the cheerful cry goes forth,
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
Each gave Tattianaâ€™s arm a nudge
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Each other as the shore we climb!
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
Economy political,
Eâ€™en as the poet says he leant.
Eâ€™en as the presence of a snake,
Eâ€™en for an instant find delight,
Eâ€™en from her cradleâ€™s earliest dream,
Eâ€™en hopeless egoismâ€™s dark shape.
Eight rubbers were already played,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
Either she saw not or ignored;
Either with him or thee in song,
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,â€”
Employ your glasses constantly,
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
Enchanted by the moonâ€™s pale beam.
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
Encountered punishment complete,
Endless conjectures all propound
Endowing us from out her store
Engrave the ice with strident noise.

Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestowsâ€”

â€œEnough, arise! for much we need
Enough, enough, conclude thy layâ€”
Enough! my pack is now unslungâ€”
â€œEnough to see one winterâ€™s end;
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
Enraptured was he if allowed
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
Epicurean philosophers,
Epistle second, note the third,
Epistles of six sheets or near,
Ere conversation could begin,
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Ere the bright messenger had set.
Ere this but one brief moment beat
_E sempre bene_, gentlemen!
Espying, Eugene with a smile
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
Et cetera_; but nothing showed
Eternally to imitate
Eugene at first began to dream,
Eugene designed with me to start
Eugene directs the trusty man
Eugene fell prostrate at her feetâ€”
Eugene fell prostrate at her feetâ€”
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
Eugene, more tolerant than this
Eugene of course related nought,
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
Eugene would speak regarding these.
Euphonious, though I know a spice
Even amusing fools we miss
Even as Moscow, city proud.
Even as the love of children dear.
Even beneath her parentsâ€™ roof
Even so! His passions soon abated,
Even the rosy wafer dries
Eventually petrify
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
Ever receive with kindly hearts
Ever to hear the same replies
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Examined, mended, newly found
Examine her from head to foot.
Exceptionless as no rule is,
Except one by the window placed
Exclaiming, â€œWe must change â€™em all!
Excruciate the heart and late
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
Existence calmly sped along,
Existence without wife or friends,
Existence would not make a curse,
Existâ€”that their immortal band
Extendedâ€”haunt which Dryads love.
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
Extinguished ashes do not blazeâ€”
Faces which we meet everywhere
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Fair source of every fine idea,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Familiar to him long ago.
Fantastic images shall swarm
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
Far from his Italyâ€”his own.
Far from the rest the pair would creep
Farther Tattianaâ€™s walks extendâ€”
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
Fashion is there immutable,
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Feeling in others much esteemed.
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
Feelings which long had ceased to be
Felled a calumniator base!
Finally tost his arms in air
First reconciled and then content;
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
Flew to collect his rural tax;
Flies past the porter to the stair,
Fly frequent to my solitude,
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Follow up loveâ€”a secret meeting
Fond declarations they invite
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
For Godâ€™s sake, Lenski, donâ€™t begin!
For I myself was thirteen quite;
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
For Moscow fops and Circes each
For a fictitious misanthrope,
For a protracted space of time.
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
For consecrate to me he fell
For dolls, eâ€™en from her earliest years,
For empty sound the rascal swore he
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
For ever faithful will abide.â€
For evermore had disappeared.
For evermore is separate.
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
For every loyal Russian breast!
For ever your Tattiana leave.
For first â€œmadameâ€ his wants observed,
For follyâ€™s dues thou hadst to pay.
For, from the outset, â€™twas unjust
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
For him an honourable grave,
For him were but of little worth,
For journalistic deglutition
For law I _far niente_ take
For longâ€”for ever. To be sure
For long he had endured them all.
For maidenâ€™s hearing deemed unfit),
For my wild garden and bookcase,â€”
For oâ€™er a word to fashion known,
For on their brows I trembling read
For otherwiseâ€”God only knows!
For our Automedons are fire
For our amusement ever made
For patience, reader, I must plead!
For promises her feet reveal
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
For rural solitude and dreams,
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
For shame lift up the modest maid.
For summer to the country flown,
For tallow, wood and other things
For the first time the hammer clicks.
For the impatient chief instead.
For there he left a mournful trace.
For the young poet they display.
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,
For treachery had done its worst;
Fortune the poet had repaid.
For twice you came to them and yet
For two whole days it seemed a change
For us, may be for many a year.
For visions of my childish years
For visions of my childish years
For was it not her duty to
For which no springtime shall appear?
(For which our praise he hath deserved).
For which the poet agonized
For who imposture can endure,
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
For your instruction here to tell
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Found the ideal of my youth,
Found them in darkness side by side,
Four deadly paces do they span;
Fragments of northern poetry,
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Fresh aspirations I have known,
Fresh cause of quarrel then Iâ€™ll find,
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
Friends of the sons of every land,
From Gottingen inspired he came,
From Romulus unto our day.
From apprehension of the cost,
From boxes or from stalls in rows.
From careless stanzas such as these,
From first to last page to the rim.
From gales a hill behind was seen;
From habit or maliciously,
From hall to yard and garden flies,
From happy inspiration flow,
From hence engrossed in thought profound
From her half-open vest of night.
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
From mere vacuity of mind
From public and from private ties,
From shades of the relentless past.
From storms protection having sought,
From such digressions wholly free.
From the dread pistol turn away.
From the moist cork the bottle freed
From whose analysis minute
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
Full many a lovely star hath night
Full of exasperating thought.
Funeral amateurs abound!
Furious he from the table rose;
Gallop, mazurka, waltzingâ€”see!
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
Gazing into his face, she said:
Gazing on Lenskiâ€™s corse did standâ€”
Gazing upon a note below.
Gazing upon a note below.
Gently for pranks he would reprove
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
Girls in anticipation skip!
Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.
Give me just half a glass of wineâ€”
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
Gliding in negligent career,
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Glittered in a perspective long,
Glory with which our history teems
Goddess of loversâ€™ tender sighs.
God grant I meet not at a ball
God grant that all who herein glance,
God knows! The very trace is lost.
God save his soul eternally
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
â€œGood-bye, OnÃ©guine, I must go.â€â€”
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
Good-night.â€ Behold! she is alone!
Go, on the Nevaâ€™s bank appear,
Grant that I err not on the road.â€
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Gravely repeating to another
Great sacrifices for his sake!
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
Guards fondly hopeâ€™s uncertain dream.
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
Gvozdine, BouyÃ noff, PÃ©tÃ²ushkoff
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Habit alleviates the grief
Habit was given us in distress
Habit would bring indifference.
Had a deluded victim been
Had bid her sigh for without hopeâ€”
Had come both friends and enemiesâ€”
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
Had finished life amid his sons,
â€œHad he been long here, and where from?
Had killed me had the like been told.â€
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
Had much to do at home that day,
Had not yet withered his young breast.
Had perished a creative mind,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Had rendered him an invalid;
Had run across her path at speed,
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
Handbook of fashionable phrase
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
Happy and glorious_. But this brings
Happy he who in youth was young,
Happy who quit lifeâ€™s banquet seat
Happy who thereto can unite
Happy who timely grew mature,
Hard by the window took her place.â€â€”
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Hateful the hollow world became,
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
Hath whiled the roadâ€™s monotony,
Haughty appear, subservient,
Have echoed to eternity.
Have eâ€™er a precious tress consigned,
Have entered never to return.
Have felt loveâ€™s agitated kiss
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
Have latterly vexatious grown;
Have my OnÃ©guineâ€”suddenly.
Have my OnÃ©guineâ€”suddenly.
Have one by one all withered grown
Have shone as one of fashionâ€™s leaders.
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Having abjured the haunts of men,
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Having for moneyâ€™s sake alone
Having lost all in life we prize.
Having once fixed your interest,
Having performed his service truly,
Having remarked Vladimirâ€™s flight,
Having this mournful document
He â€œBenedettaâ€ used to hum,
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
Heard he the truth? And thus she couldâ€”
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Hears not my importunity!
Heart would not throb albeit in jestâ€”
Heaved an involuntary sigh
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
He back as from a sudden blow?â€”
He bending whispered in her ear
He bends his course to Talonâ€™s, where
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
He brought from mystic Germany
He called to mind Tattianaâ€™s grace,
He called upon me Christmas Eveâ€”
He _cannot_ give me happiness.â€
He cared no longer there to stay,
He conversation would have ledâ€”
He could in disputation shine
He daily in his drives drew near
He deemed his coming would inspire
He deemed his friends but longed to make
He deemed of human life the goal
He dragged her by a forest road
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
He drops his pistol silently.
Heedless of your despairing cry?
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
He enters. High the cork arose
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
He enters: rapidly discussion
He enters the saloon. â€™Tis blank!
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He eyed her with a fond concern,
He feared the criminal might try
He felt the laudable desire
He finally lost all delight
He fixedly upon her staresâ€”
He found him on the table laid,
He found them in an almanac,
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
He gazed upon the clock which showed
He had excepted from the ban:
He has returned, say in what guise?
He hath acquired the worldâ€™s esteem
â€œHe hath neglected us of late.â€â€”
He heard his soulâ€™s complaint within,
He hies unto the â€œBoulevard,â€
He in imagination saw
He in the early years of life
He is a charming youth and wise.
He is not there: I am not known:
He kindled his poetic flame.
He knew not how to spend his life.
He knits his browsâ€”â€™tis silent all.
He knows Kaverine will repair.
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
He left _you_ first, and I must own
He leisurely adorns for her.
He lies, upon his forehead death,
He long should have been on the road.
He loved the simpleton to mock,
He marmot-like did hibernate,
He might his motives have narrated,
He mused: â€œI will her saviour be!
He nears a spacious mansionâ€™s gate,
He neâ€™er shall hear Timeâ€™s eulogy,
He now a full possession takes,
He obstinately will remain,
He offers her his murderous paw;
He oft upon his lips would curb,
He on his bosom gently placed
He on the conflagration frowned.
He ought to have conciliated
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
â€œHe promised here this day to ride,â€
He quits the fashionable throng
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
Her Moscow cousin, often told
He racked his brains to find its clue
Her agitation and distress
Her all in all did constitute;
Her amorous experience
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
Her brow she did not eâ€™en contract
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Herds low, and under nightâ€™s dark veil
Here I remark all poets are
He read as vainly as before,
He reads at random, reads in vain.
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
Here bottles stand in close array,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
â€œHere, he resides with Simeon.
Herein my portrait should detect,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
Her features no grimaces bleared;
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Her figure perfect grows with time!
Her foot was in my other hand.
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
Her glance how wild yet genial!
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
Her handkerchief she loses now;
Her head upon her breast declines
Her health, lifeâ€™s sweetness and its bloom,
Her heart how full of gentleness,
Her heart importunately turns.
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
He rings in haste; in haste arrives
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her manners were deliberate,
Her money counted, and designed
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
He roars, and â€œAh!â€ Tattiana cries.
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
He round the billiard-table stalked,
Her passionâ€™s faithful counterpart,
Her path across the plain doth keepâ€”
Her promptings unto law did make,
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
Herself not knowing well the reason,
Her sentimental verses all,
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
Her shoulderâ€”Olga swiftly cameâ€”
Her shoulders, breast and face to laveâ€”
Her sisterhood delights the young
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
Her toiletteâ€™s antiquated style,
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
Her utterances ever heard,
Her weary eyes are filled with tearsâ€”
Her with a smile old women greet,
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
Heâ€™s a freemason, so we think.
He salutary rules poured forth?
He sang of lifeâ€™s fresh colours stained
He sang of loveâ€”to love a slave.
He sang of separation grim,
Heâ€™s a straightforward little chap.â€
He sat, and then the livelong day,
He seemed for matrimony born.
He shunned those parties boisterous;
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
He somewhat blushing would omit:
He still made love in a queer way;
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
He there is masterâ€”that is plain;
He thought so, and existence charmed.
He thought to write, but labour long
He took no more the slightest heed;
He took the room wherein the old
He to the festival repairs,
He used to hateâ€”and was no foolâ€”
He usually was glad to see
He wakesâ€”they with a letter comeâ€”
He wanders in his indolence;
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
He was a dear delightful foolâ€”
He was an honest gentleman,
He was beloved: or say at least,
He was deceived. Just as before
He was in error; for Eugene
He was most gay. The happy date
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
He was no more! The youthful bard
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
He went notâ€”sooner was prepared
He who economy abhorred,
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
He who lifeâ€™s frosts which early wrung
He whom we sing to shall be made
He will delight you, I am sure,
He with an innocence extreme
He with his little maiden played,
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
He would not that a man ye slay
He writes upon his parentsâ€™ tomb,
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
He wrote (â€™tis the romantic style,
He yawns, averts his countenance,
Hid in the gondolaâ€™s dark shade,
Highways all Russia will unite
Him a disquietude did seize,
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
Himself transformed into a hack;
Him who inspired both love and awe,
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
His ardent soul with full delight.
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
His bit with foam besprinkled oâ€™er,
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
His breast was riddled through and through,
His butting horns in anger bent,
His care unto his pistolsâ€™ plight,
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
His chambers close wherein confined
His character attracted me.
His comedies, a noisy rout,
His constant soul could ever tire,
His course unto the running brook.
His cup unto his maiden dear.
His daily occupations, lo!
His daughterâ€™s book to ascertain
His ditties were as pure and bright
His double sashes and his grate,
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
His energy and impotence.
His entrance with OnÃ©guine. â€œAh!
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
His fate shall presently decide.
His fist OnÃ©guine fiercely shook
His footing on the treacherous rime
His friends and also enemies
His friendship I acquired just then;
His furs are powdered on the way
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
His harp beneath that sky had rung
His hate by slander, and who spends
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
His heart reciprocated still
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
His immorality of mind
His inner consciousness laid bare,
His intellect in close array.
His kneeling posture he retainsâ€”
His kneeling posture he retainsâ€”
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
His malady, whose cause I ween
His momentary loving glance
His mother from the door doth scold.
His mournful heart no peace could find,
His name: the tenderness of home
His neighbourâ€™s lowly tomb and mourned
His own antagonists expert,
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
His recent glory he invokes.
His relative and friend as well.
His ruffian bravery adored,
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
His son and mortgages his lands.
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
His son is married, just conceive!â€
His soul by crash of music fired,
His spirit sank with strange delight.
His spirit was intent upon.
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
His tea with rum no more desired,
His transports were quite maidenly,
His travels like all other things
His uncle, busy man indeed,
His valet brings him letters three.
His vanity first let us pique
His visit she had not awaited,
His wadded coat and cap with peak
His watch, the sun in turn he viewsâ€”
His weary head declined at rest,
His wife approaches, with him leads
His wife was also mad upon
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
Homeward returning, he at home
Honour and pride inflexible.
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
Hope with her fascinating power
Horror! had she not better stay
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
â€œHow Tania grows! Doth it appear
â€œHow are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
How artless was the note which spoke
How bitterly he would malign,
How bright and tender was his look,
â€œHow came you then to wed a man?â€â€”
How charming Olgaâ€™s shoulders grow!
How dark the night is getting though!
How deftly could he transport feign!
â€œHow dull you are this morning, nurse!â€
How empires store of wealth unfold,
However, Taniaâ€™s letter reading,
However cherries might abound,
However, the mazurka lacks
How flourish, why and wherefore less
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,â€â€”
How full of fire his speech would glow!
How in the country pass this time?
How like a poet was my chum
How like the billow I desired
Howl like a dolt: â€™tis meant for me!
How mean, how pusillanimous!
How meekly then I heard you preachâ€”
How meekly then I heard you preachâ€”
How much is in that word expressed!
â€œHow now, OnÃ©guine, yawning still?â€â€”
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
â€œHow often in thine arms I lay;
How oft the kindly Muse away
How oft to the Crimean shore
How oft, when on a summer night
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
How pleasantly the evening jogs
How sick to death his uncle lay
How soon he learnt deceptionâ€™s art,
How soon he learnt to titillate
How soon to habits she conformed
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
How the young imp on Tania doted!
How thoroughly her part she took!
How thy hands burn!â€â€”â€œDear nurse, Iâ€™m well.
How well he played the greenhornâ€™s part
How with thy medal I would play,
Hung like a print against the wall,
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Hymenâ€™s embarrassments, distress,
I Apuleius gladly read
I, after so much eloquence,
I also wandered there of old,
I am acquainted with fresh care,
â€œI am in love,â€ her whispers tell
I am in love, my hour hath come!
â€œI am in love, nurse! leave me now.â€
I amâ€”in loveâ€”you knowâ€”donâ€™t tell!â€
I am not strong enough to state;
I am not worthy them in aught;
I ask, all ye who poets are,
I blame not your behaviourâ€”
I blame not your behaviourâ€”
I by the button-hole seize fast
â€œI call to witness God on highâ€”â€
I cannot help it I declare,
I cannot tell on what pretenceâ€”
I cannot tell the reason why,
I cannot understand. But lo!
I canâ€™t conceive a little dear
I canâ€™t translate the adjective.
â€œI celebrate a comrade young
â€œIdeal,â€ he had drowsy grown.
â€œIdeas and time neâ€™er backward move;
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
I did not please you. Why pursue
I did not please you. Why pursue
Idolatry of liberty,
I envied sore the billows tall,
If Olga smilingly approve,
If but to lighten Timeâ€™s dull rate,
If cleverly or not I prate.
If he had only known the wound
If his hot hand encountered hers,
If in the scenes of home I might
If not, the money I will lend.â€
I formerly admired her much
If seriously he hath disease;
If the choice in my power were,
If the choice in my power were,
â€œIf the domestic hearth could blessâ€”
If the poor maiden could have guessed
If the raw product they possess
If they but heard domestic loads
If they were similar in aught.
If thou wert sitting by my side,
If wife and children to possess
I guard it as a holy thing,
I have dreamed many a vision fair
I have endured without respite.
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
I have known beauties cold and raw
I have no leisure here to dwell,
I just hint, in parenthesis,
I know not if his heart felt pain
I know that Parnyâ€™s tender pen
I know thereâ€™s none more amiable.
I lift a warning voice because
I like the difference to express
I like this word exceedingly
Iâ€™ll pass beneath the firmament,
Iâ€™ll sprinkle thee with holy water.â€”
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
I long by ballets have been bored,
I long enough deceived have erred.
I long have ceased to offend the laws.
I loved youâ€”what did I obtain?
I loved youâ€”what did I obtain?
I love its furious delight,
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
I love youâ€”to what end deceive?â€”
I love you with a brotherâ€™s love,
Imaginationâ€™s sacred fires,
I marriedâ€”now, I supplicateâ€”
Iâ€™m beaten in another matter;
I mean my name not to repeat.â€
â€œIâ€™m happy, say, is it not so?â€â€”
I might to connoisseurs repeat
Immersed in melancholy thought,
Immersed in secret thought I stand
Iâ€™m not for witchcraft now inclined.
Iâ€™m oâ€™er it ever pondering.
I mourn, but tears I cannot shedâ€”
Impatient, boiling oâ€™er with wrath,
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
Impatient waits the close of day,
Impelled by Springâ€™s dissolving beams,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
Impelled to union with his own
Imperial portraits hang around
Impetuously clove its way
Imploring looks and mute complaint
Imploring looks and mute complaint
Impressed him in the least degree,â€”
Impressionable for an hour,
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
I mused: perhaps the matterâ€™s squaredâ€”
I must resign myself, in sooth;
In Olgaâ€™s album, youthful maid,
In Olgaâ€™s and Tattianaâ€™s rooms
In Olgaâ€™s face no lifeâ€™s displayed.
In Russ her love made manifest,
In Taniaâ€™s praise in pouch he brought,
In age the memory gets worse,
In a half-open dressing-gown
In aimless ease and far from strife,
In a lax or informal way,
In amorous flights when so inspired,
In books he saw nought to condemn
In boston and the game of age,
In bud of promise incomplete,
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
Incessantly his chains to break.â€
In charming fashion mutilate?
Incited by his stormy Muse
In clouds of steam above perceive.
In coach or post-cart duly placed
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
In company, or simply bowed,
In consultation stand asideâ€”
In correspondence been allowed.
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
In country towns, where still it keeps
In course of time (the whole extent
In cruel solitude each day
Indeed, by force of magnetism
Indifferent he became to all,
Indifferent was her future fate.
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
In dreams and what the moon foretold
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
In duel having killed his friend
In fact, some people were assured
In fact, the subject analysed,
Infallibly you there will find
Inflict annoyance and distress
In former years thus did not I
â€œInform me, prince, pray dost thou know
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
In groups, official striplings glance
Inhabited the country, clad
In haunts of fashion where each day
In her affairs neâ€™er interfered,
In her friendsâ€™ albums, time had been,
Inheritor of all his race.
In history he took no pleasure,
In hopes of everlasting fame
In horror for itself alone,
In idleness and tranquil joy
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
In life domestic see a string
In little maidens of thirteen?
In love adventures she was versed,
In love, although its tempests vex,
In love-lorn meditation sad.
In loveâ€™s campaigns OnÃ©guine heard
In many things had changed his lifeâ€”
In melancholy loveliness,
In mist profound all yet is hid.
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
In mother Winterâ€™s strange caprice.
In motley and amusing chase.
In much his conduct stigmatized;
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
In my young days of wild delight
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
In old age life is weariness!â€
In one great shout: sheâ€™s mine! sheâ€™s mine!
In one he doth accounts behold,
In one of thine enchanting lays
In one thing really did excel.
In order due the maidens pull;
In pages of a love narration
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
In rhyming I show laziness.
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
In scenes like these it may be though,
Insensible her hand remains
Insensible her hand remains
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
Inseparable from our lot;
Inseparable soon they be.
Inseparable they remained.
In serious mood or dalliance
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
In silence shall I sit and yawn
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
In solid, unpretentious style,
In solitude or worldly din,
In some a willing martyrdom.
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
Inspired but weariness intense;
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
Inspired him with disgust and so
In spite of common sense weâ€™re wont
In spring-time, heard the cygnetâ€™s note
In springtime on the meadows green,
Instructed jestingly the boy,
In such an album with delight
Interrogation to denote.
In that morass where you and I
In the French language perfectly,
In the Lyceumâ€™s noiseless shade
In the beginning, cold and mute,
In the beginning of this lay,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
In the dawn of existence drear.
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
In the first place, say, am I right?
In their sterility of prattle,
In the lone garden and the lane?
In the lone garden and the lane?
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
In the meantime the mill inspects.
In the recesses what hath stirred
In the unfettered hours of leisure
In the unmoved, magnificent
In the worldâ€™s mortal revelries,
In the worldâ€™s vortex my success,
In this case quite mistaken was.
In this the love of the fair sex
In three weeks would arrive for them;
In thy imagination warm,
In time Iâ€™ll give ye without fail
In times gone by thy bare commandâ€”â€
Into accounts would sometimes look,
Into delicious bondage gave
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
Into the chamber where he slept
Into the cups already sped
Into the district then to boot
Into the lonely house she went,
Into the starry night extend.
Into the study of the boy
Into the tangled garden goes
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
Introduce verse in conversation.
In true interpretation hates:
In truth he had the happy trick
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
In vain was youth by us received,
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
Invigorate imagination
In what he merely acquiesced.
In whispers low the neighbours said:
In winter by its blank and dim
In winter on the fender bright,
In winter time would often come.
In winter, when Night longer holds
In worldly din or solitude
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
In your young days and also mine),
I once forgot for your sweet cause
I on my chosen hero dote;
I owe the censorship a little.
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
I promised!â€”Did I so?â€”Well, there!
I sail upon my lake at times
I say without poetic phrase,
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
Is ever ready to proclaim
Is ever ready with relief,
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
Is full of frigid jealousy,
â€œI shall expire,â€ Tattiana cried,
â€œIs he known to you?â€â€”â€œYes and No.â€
â€œIs he the same or grown more wise?
I should alarm our friendship tried:
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Is it for long?â€â€”â€œMa chÃ¨re cousine!â€
Is it not true? the objects fair,
Is it that I am now compelled
Is it that I am now compelled
Is it that ardent souls of flame
Is it that human restlessness
I slumber much, a little read,
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Is occupied with Olga fair,
Is once again made manifest.
Is once again made manifest.
(I speak not of our poems here),
Is petted by the Emperor?â€”
Is petted by the Emperor?â€”
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
â€œIs she in love?â€ quoth one. â€œWith whom?
Is still condemned in love to be;
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
I still a complication view,
Istomina(*) the nimbly-bounding;
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
It blew: it howled: till winter eâ€™en
It carries of antiquity
It gradually possessed his mind;
I thank thee. In thy company,
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
I the same admonition make.
It matters not. Hope eâ€™en to these
It may be that I did proceedâ€”
It may be that his martyred shade
It may be ye were born, or there
It now to investigate is time,
It occupied him from a boy,
I tried when I began this tale,
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
Its driver seated on the rim
Its ebullition foaming white
Its insignificance I know
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
Its passions and its modes of thought.
Its splendour and its blandishments,
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
It wakens in my breast again.
It was a cheery, generous
It whiled his idle hours away
It will be by a mob beset
I uttered to my lady fair
Ivan PetrÃ²vitch still a gaby,
Iâ€™ve had to make for having friends!
Iâ€™ve scanned it with a jealous eye,
Iâ€™ve thought well oâ€™er the general plan,
Iâ€™ve wasted in amusements vain,
I was for calm existence made,
I was half silly with affright.
I was incensed and he was sad.
â€œI weep. And if within your breast
â€œI weep. And if within your breast
I will descant on loveâ€™s sweet dream,
I will not wed, and ever weeps
I will with thy divinity
â€œI with my friend intend to fight!â€
â€œI wonâ€™t detain you; but â€™tis hard
I would desire my bride to beâ€”
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
I would your vigilance arouse,
I write, and anguish flies away,
I yield for splendid vanities,
I yield the fruit of work severe.
I yield with a low reverence;
Jackdaws on every spireâ€”in scores.
Jaws are at work. On every side
Jealousy and vexation took
Jiltedâ€”glad of a holiday.
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Judge then what roses would be ours,
Just as he entered. How severe!
Just at a moment which I grieve
Just at that time his father died,
Just at the hour we designate
Just at this moment I cannot.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Just manages a feeble trot
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
Just so! that modest swain is blest
Keep your accounts! Youâ€™d rather not?
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Known unto children perfectly:
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;
Ladies in crowds around her close,
Laid down his life of sun and storm
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
Landscapes thereon he would design,
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Late in the afternoon to rise,
Latest arrivalsâ€™ salutations,
Latin is just now not in vogue,
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
Lay languishing both day and nightâ€”
Lead into good society,
Leaning against the dam expects,
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
Learn to possess more self-control.
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
Lenski as a good match received,â€”
Lenski at intervals would dare,
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Lenski his pencil-case took out
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
Lenski the foemanâ€™s apparition
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
Lenski unto the dame replied,
Lessons to give he understood!
Lest jaded with satiety,
Lest the malicious reader or
Lest the world or her lord divine
Let me explain that in my song
Let me present ye to the man,
Let not the poetâ€™s spirit freeze,
Let us congratulations pay
Let us go seek a little restâ€”
Let us proceed unto a rill,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Light sallies without coxcombry,
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Like Leonora did she ride
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Like a Bacchante in her sport
Like a full moon magnificent.
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Like down from Aeolusâ€™s lip,
Like him renouncing vanity,
Like his, her dress was always nice,
(Like love, another sort of knavery!)
(Like other things I could relate)
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strownâ€”
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
Likewise an epitaph with tears
Like you and me and all the rest?â€”
Listen to me without disdain.
Listless is she the livelong day
List! the snow crunchesâ€”he draws nigh!
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Lo! in my garden was she found
Lo! my OnÃ©guine free as air,
Lo! my OnÃ©guine rural lord!
Long ago?â€â€”â€œâ€™Tis the second year.â€
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Longer the East inert reclines
Long in this fashionable cell
Long, long the hour had past when home
Long since I held thee at the fontâ€”
Longtime her mind is occupied.
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
Long time her young imagination
Long time in meditation deep
Longtime was her heart desolate
Long tortured by his lay divine,
â€œLook quickly to your left, my sweet!â€
Looks upon all with absent gaze
Look through the window and kill flies.
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
Lord Byronâ€™s portrait on the wall
Lost in the hamlet far away.
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
Lo! through the frozen windows play
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
Loveâ€™s pangs Tattiana agonize.
Loveâ€™s tender transports and distress,
Love to idealize inclined;
Love to inspire doth woe appear
Lo! with what pride celestial
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Made me so tipsy long ago!
Made revelations undesigned,
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Maidens before her meekly move
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Make up your mind to go there.â€â€”â€œAh!
Malek Adel and De Linar,
Malicious and a slanderer.
Malignant fury they disclose,
Manâ€”forty years long in this wiseâ€”
Many an ancient legend which
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
Mark ye with what a modest air
Marmontel also, tome the third;
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
May be, and this my terror wakes,
May be that I by heavenâ€™s decrees
May be the empire of the sense,
May find a crumb to satisfy.
May well in innocence impart.
May yet be studious of his nails;
â€œMe?â€â€”â€œYes! It is Tattianaâ€™s fÃªte
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Meantime Iâ€™ll finish whilst I can
Meantime OnÃ©guineâ€™s apparition
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Meantime in matutinal dress
Measured with great exactitude.
(_Mechanically_, let us add),
Meet punishment for him provide.
Men become friends from idleness.
Mends with the Russian hammerâ€™s blows
Men love no more, as only the
Men opposite. The cross they sign
Me now, inflict upon me pain?â€”
Me now, inflict upon me pain?â€”
Men will forget me, but my urn
Merciful God, what will he deem?â€
Method was dear unto his heart
Metreless verses recognizing
Me your perfections would not bless;
â€™Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
â€œMine!â€ cried Eugene with savage tone.
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
Minutely I will now portray.
Miraculously fair arise,
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
Modest yet daring! And a tear
Moina recalls for this alone
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
â€œMonsieur lâ€™AbbÃ©â€ a starving Gaul,
Morality taught scarce at all;
More advantageously appear
More blooming than the Boreal flame
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
More crimson every moment they.
More satisfaction to her taste.
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
More timid than a doe long chased,
More troublesome than usual?â€â€”â€œNo!
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
Morningâ€™s forerunners, breezes blow
Mortally sick I am indeed.
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
Moscowâ€™s young Graces at her stare,
Most by this circumstance offended
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Most usually a Cossack horse
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
Mountains weâ€™ll level and through deep
Mournful Loveâ€™s deadly trace appears
Mournful is thine approach to me,
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
Must be pronounced unfortunateâ€”
Must bow in common courtesy;
Must eâ€™en despise his kind at last;
Must now my stanzas occupy.
Must take a walk and rest a bitâ€”
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
Mute glances interchanged aside
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
Mutual destruction to contrive.
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
My beauty, thou art ready too.
â€œMy chum lives here,â€ Bruin grunts out.
My country and an exileâ€™s lot;
My countryâ€™s honour and repute
â€œMy darling child, thou art in pain.â€”
â€œMy darling, growing old am I!
My famous portrait indicate
My friends, the poet ye regret!
My friends, what means this odd digression?
My friend, â€™tis but to pay a debt,
My frivolous and jolly youth.
My goddesses, where are your shades?
My gratitude do not disdain,
My heart of old would captivate.
â€œMy heartâ€™s delight, thou art not well.â€â€”
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
My image hath not disappeared,
My image hath not disappeared,
My joy in youth was fleeting eâ€™en
My light productions to retain,
My little book. With thee I knew
My lot is fixedâ€”with thoughtlessness
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
My memory wandered wide and sought
My morning birdie, yesternight
My mother-in-law who lately died
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
My pen no longer finds delight,
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
My pretty self-deceiving maidâ€”
My scholar without aptitude
â€œMy second!â€ cried in turn Eugene,
My soul I cannot renovateâ€”
My soul is filled with gratitude!
My soul is filled with gratitude!
My spirit and my blood doth move,
My spirit with such pangs before.
My splendid house and gaietiesâ€”
My sportive Muse I used to take
Mysteriously all objects near
My sum of happiness contained;
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
ï»¿â€œMy uncleâ€™s goodness is extreme,
My unpretending page shall fill,
My venerated reader, oh!
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
My very latest composition!
My word of honour given have I.
My wretched Lenskiâ€™s fate I mourn,
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
Napoleon tarried till it please
Nay, nearâ€”but destiny decreedâ€”
Near Kharitonâ€™s in a side street
Nearer they comeâ€”Eugene appears!
Nearest and dearest knew not how
Near young Tattiana resident,
Neâ€™er touched her fingers indolent
Neâ€™er trusted to the treacherous ace.
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
Never for me to reappearâ€”
Never upon my heroine
Next Saturday. The LÃ rina
Night separated from her spouse,
No answer! He another sent.
No answer all that day was borne.
Noblesse and models of the mode,
No coquetry was there, I vouchâ€”
No fond illusions live to soothe,
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
No greater pleasure can exist
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
No longer through her former home;
â€œNo matter, look immediately.
â€œNo misery I see in thatâ€â€”
No more at dawn the shepherd will
No more remembered him; unto
No more the music thunders loud,
No more the village knows his face,
No more with pale Dianaâ€™s rays,
None, be my witness Heaven above!
None could a trace of that impute,
None could her beautiful declare,
None the conviction could withstand
No, never in the early blaze
No noveltyâ€”is it not true?â€”
No noveltyâ€”is it not true?â€”
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
No obstacle of which I know.
No one appeared to lend a hand.
No one the contrary will urge,
No other book had time to read.
No other than OnÃ©guine mine.
Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor boston nor the worldâ€™s affairs
Nor by her beauty she became
Nor by her sisterâ€™s brilliancy
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Nor did her blushes fade away,
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
Nor discontinued to distress
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
Nor even tears afford respite,
Nor frigid adulation paid.
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
Nor further comment that night made.
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Nor long his mind was agitated
Nor marked how summerâ€™s prime had fled
Nor on the letter yet hath she
Nor precepts sage nor pictures eâ€™en,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Nor shall the caterpillar come
Nor slander viciously could spread
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Nor the frost particles inhale
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Nor years of separation all
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
No senseless fashionable lay
No sense was ever manifest
No signs of trouble her accused,
Not a bad fellow was her father
Not agony, but death expressed.
Not all will like myself proceedâ€”
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
â€œNot at all.â€â€”â€œThat I canâ€™t conceive!
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
Not even a poetic phrase,
Not high in general estimation;
â€œNothing, good nurse, thereâ€™s nothing wrong,
No time to pick it up! afraid,
â€œNot in the least, assured am I!â€â€”
Not knowing its interpretation,
Not only sorrowâ€”Ah! my dear,
No trace ye left in passing by
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
Not so! My Moscow never went
Not that she had his works perused,
Not the least trace OnÃ©guine sees
Not the young timid maid, believe,
Not to behave as he did onceâ€”
Nought but of dinners a long row,
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Nought in the universe refused:
Nought of its charms original
November at the gate did stand.
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!â€
Now I am fit for nothing here.
Now I am ready to refuse.
Now all things round about repeat
Now a long branch itself entwined
Now, as in a deserted house,
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Now donâ€™t be cross with me, my soul,
Now for the first time I my Muse
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
Now her lithe form she arches oâ€™er
Now it is ready to be sentâ€”
Now, like hereditary foes,
Now of a family the head,
Now talkative, now reticent;
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
Now with what eager interest
â€œNurse, leave me. I would be alone.
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
â€œNurse, â€™tis so close I cannot rest.
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
O Men, how very like ye are
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
Obedient she had ever been
Obedient then to Natureâ€™s law,
Obedient to the magic strings,
Obedient to warm Springâ€™s commands.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?â€”
Oblivion of lifeâ€™s tempest dire,
Obsequious or indifferent!
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
O epic Muse, my powers increase
Oâ€™er all a sheet of silvery dust
Oâ€™er hillock and oâ€™er meadow throws.
Oâ€™er my remains to drop a tear,
Oâ€™erspread with Winterâ€™s carpet bright,
Oâ€™erwhelmed with guests; by families
Of Africa, ancestral land,
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
Of Levshinâ€™s school ye followers,
Of London life is â€œvulgarâ€ called
Of Olga he in song averred;
Of Russian domesticity;
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
Of affectation innocent,
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Of all the guests within his mind.
Of a most mournful episode,
Of a strange night when the moon andâ€”
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
Of censure for the same incurred;
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
Of â€œcomme il faut.â€ ShishkÃ²ff, forgive!
Of consolation all bereftâ€”
Of conversation, thought and aimsâ€”
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
Of creditors a hungry rout
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
Of dreary Russia left behind,
O feet, whereâ€™er your path extends
Of error and the passionsâ€™ strife.
Of every sort and every set!â€â€”
Of fashionable dames the foe,
Of fiery youthâ€™s untutored days
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
Of foreign whims the impersonationâ€”
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
Of friends the grateful intercourseâ€”
Of friends unceremonious would
Of frivolous existence, friends;
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Of her provincial innocence
Of his approach; but nothing cared
Of horn in circle call them round.
Of keen sarcastic intellect
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of languor and of love did tell
Of late I have been quite absurd,â€”
Of life or death predestinate.
Of love again, and yet again;
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Of many an economic scheme;
Of migratory gipsy hordesâ€”
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
Of modern Russians the disease.
Of my impassioned heroine.
Of my light paramour was proud.
Of old maids the divinity,
Of passion reminiscences,
Of passion they so often raise.
Of pictures painful harrowing,
Of priceless value all things seem
Of roses to romancers dear;
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
Of such a dread hallucination.
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
Of tender years the modesty
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
Of the commencement of the piece.
Of the cup brimming oâ€™er with wineâ€”
Of the domains of the side-scene.
Of the horizon she is like!â€â€”
Of the imperial Nevaâ€™s shore.
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Of the Ã†neid, but incorrect.
Of the night sentinels arise
Of the romances she preferred,
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Of touching lightly every theme.
Oft staring through the window pane
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Of untold gain she must conceal,
Of what he thought and what believed,
Of what not, and of distant dim,
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Of whirligigs were very fond,
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Oh! I accept. And instantly
â€œOh! I remember, where is he?â€â€”
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
â€œOh! how our years are vanishing!â€
Oh, many a year hath run its course
â€œOh! nurse, nurse, you donâ€™t understand!
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
â€œOh! what a fool our neighbour is!
Oh! what had been his eminence!
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
â€œOh! whither have ye winged your way,
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Oh! who is not calumnious?
Old age through spectacles too peers,
Old peopleâ€™s simple conversations
Old women at the coachmen swear.
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
Olga began to long likewise
Olga he sees before his eyes
Olga ran skipping from the door.
Olgaâ€™s admirer came that day:
Olga the tea must superviseâ€”
Olga with trepidation dire.
â€œOlinka is her junior, see.
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
On Lenskiâ€™s matrimonial fate
On Sundays by yon window he,
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
On balls I madly used to dote,
Once more to idleness consigned,
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
(One and the same thing it may be)
One image occupied his mind,
One instrument for his own useâ€”
One momentâ€™s slumber suffer not.
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
On everything around her gaze,
On fresh allurements they are bent,
On guests their servants used to wait
â€œOnÃ©guine, I was younger then,
â€œOnÃ©guine, I was younger then,
OnÃ©guine Olga bore away.
OnÃ©guine, O my gentle readers,
OnÃ©guine acted very well
â€œOnÃ©guine, all this sumptuousness,
OnÃ©guine, bored to death again,
OnÃ©guine, by first impulse moved,
OnÃ©guine could not now submit,
OnÃ©guine firedâ€”Alas! alas!
OnÃ©guine, hast forgotten yet
OnÃ©guine, hast forgotten yet
OnÃ©guine his excuses says;
OnÃ©guine knew enough, the rogue
OnÃ©guine lightning glances shot;
OnÃ©guine meditative stood,
OnÃ©guine neâ€™er as poet showed
OnÃ©guine oped the cupboards wide.
OnÃ©guine sat the table by
OnÃ©guineâ€™s cheek grew ashy pale,
OnÃ©guineâ€™s letter!â€â€”â€œAh! the thing!
OnÃ©guine slowly then began
OnÃ©guineâ€™s pencillings. His mind
OnÃ©guineâ€™s speeches I abhorred
OnÃ©guineâ€”take him up againâ€”
OnÃ©guineâ€”the beloved place
OnÃ©guine then approached and said:
OnÃ©guine to the window went
OnÃ©guine waits on us, â€™tis like.â€
OnÃ©guine was a citizen
OnÃ©guine wasâ€”so many deemed
OnÃ©guine wasted; on my word,
OnÃ©guine was the most impressed,
OnÃ©guine went with trepidation
OnÃ©guine whither gallops? Ye
On him spleen mounted sentinel
On horseback every day they rideâ€”
On horseback gallop oâ€™er the steppe!
On innocent delights I dote,
On iron bridges we shall gaze
On lines invisible are fixt;
Only her countenance assumed
On melted wax in water poured;
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
On such a day. O Heavens, â€™tis she!
On sunny days the glistening rime,
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
On the dull stage find all things changed,
On thee I used to meditate!
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
On this artistical retreat
On unknown female forms he throws.
On us beyond the grave attends,
On waves by tempests curdled oâ€™er!
On whom a sisterâ€™s heart was set
On winters of the south a skit,
Opened the portals of the tomb
Opened with care, and entering bore
Openly or â€™neath decent cloak.
Opens unto her visitor.
Open the windowâ€”sit by me.â€
Oppressive now is happiness,
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
Or Bogdanovitchâ€™s sweet lays.
Or â€œIdol mio,â€ and in the grate
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
Or, after dinnerâ€™s dull repast,
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Or any trifle else ye like
Or a professor in tulle cap.
Or, as it were, the Freischutzâ€™ score
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
Or a swift meteor, may be,
Or at a promenade mayhap,
Or better,â€”like a faithful wife.
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
Or bosom full of languid fire,â€”
Or but for fame he saw the light;
Or by a card our homage pay,
Or by the oceanâ€™s rocky shore.
Or counting on his uncleâ€™s death
Or couplets more ingenious still;
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Or eâ€™en Istomina, my dear,
Or eâ€™en the â€œDemonâ€ of my strain.
Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
Or even overcome by wrath
Or even, silent and resigned,
Or faults of grammar on its pageâ€”
Or for the solitary tomb
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
Or, heedless of the leavesâ€™ return
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Or if he meant to flirt again,
Original imagination,
Or in a squabble to engage,
Or innocently past me fly.
Or into bold hands anxiously
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
Or kiss the border of her dress.
Or letters of a maiden young.
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Or, parable more flattering,
Or parody of modern ways?
Or quietly partake our woe.
Or recognized not in the crowd.
Or reconciled them, it may be,
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
Or that adoring Grandison
Or the delivery of a note.
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
Or vainly â€™mid luxurious fare
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
Or will my melancholy glance
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
Other and colder thoughts affright,
O triumphs of my guileless days,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Our dear old aunt, Princess HelÃ¨ne,
Our fathers used to dote upon;
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
Our hero stops and doth alight,
Our idol, Honourâ€™s motive force,
Our liberty at least survives:
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
Ourselves as unities to count;
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
Our union would produce but grief.
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
Outlandish and provincial,
Outside descend the mists of night.
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared.â€
O ye whom tender love hath pained
Page after page continued reading,
Pair after pair the race sustain.
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
Pallid and melancholy face,
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Pardon I ask for such a sinâ€”
Paris and Menelaus right.
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Passed into dull eternity,
Passes the torrent But alack!
Passionâ€™s wild sway I then allowed,
Past darkened windows and long streets
Past palaces and nunneries,
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Pedantic although scholar like,
Pen, paper bring: the table too
Perceived that he was still beloved,
Perchance he will to all the three.
Perchance one more affectionate.
Perchance some heart â€™twill agitate,
Perchance they laurels also cullâ€”
Perchance to benefit mankind,
Perchance upon the Neva eâ€™en
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
Perchance you also soon may burn,
Perched on a gooseâ€™s neck a skull
Perish absorbed by Letheâ€™s stream.
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!â€â€”
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
Pervaded with much common sense.
Perverse, unfavourable views?
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Philanthropist or patriot,
Philosopher just turned eighteen.
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
Placed at the customary range;
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
PÃ©lagie Nikolavna has
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Poetical enthusiast,
Poetic transport. They impart
Poetic transport did infuse,
Polite demeanour to preserve,
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
â€œPoor Yorick,â€ mournfully he said,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Portrayed contemporary man
Portray the solitary den
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
Possession hath no power to please,
Possess my love and sympathy.
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Pray is it he? It is the same.
Pray is it not a tough affair
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
Present me.â€â€”â€œYou are joking.â€â€”â€œNo.â€â€”
Presents her quarto amiably,
Preserves and an eternal prattle
Prevailed at last. She in reply
Priams of country populations
â€œPrincesse, mon ange!â€â€”â€œPachette!â€â€”â€œAline!â€
Proceeds, until she from a hill
Professions eagerly for deeds,
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
PÃ©tÃ²ushkoff met the selfsame doom.
PÃ©tÃ²ushkoff, the provincial swell;
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
Quarrels among young friends he bred
_Quâ€™ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
Quick to the country let us wend
Quite a sensation; the position
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
Raged round him and of balked desire!
Raises within my breast as oft
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
Rebuffedâ€”as quickly reassured,
Received him freely at her house,
Recent instructions of its mother.
Recovering, Tania gazes round;
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Reform me both in deed and word,
Regained authority awhile,
Rekindled in my withered heart
Relate some ancient history.â€
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Remained with him the youthful maid.
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
Remarkable. She then indeed
Removed her to his country seat,
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
Repentance wields not now her spell
Replaced them in their box, undressed
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Repose from labour, satire keen,
Repose her silken curtains fled,
Repose in peace, thou child of song_.â€
Rescue me from oblivion.
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Resounding through all ages might
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
Retained the image, though short-lived,
Returning, from his ship amid
_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.
Reviews both dress and countenance,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Rings from a dish of water full
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
Romance of love I pray refer,
Romances pleased her from the first,
Romances three, in which ye scan
Rooted unto the spot remained.
Round which revolves the universe.
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Russiaâ€™s Terpsichore review
Said something in an undertone
Sailed silently in unisonâ€”
Sails her allotted course on high,
Saint Priest, who every albumâ€™s page
Sang childhoodâ€™s pastimes and its joy,
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
Satan will jest, and at loveâ€™s cost.
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
â€œSay, of the two which was Tattiana?â€
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
Scarce to her questions he responds,
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
Scornfully challenged you afieldâ€”
Seated, a curious look with glasses
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
Secure in rural quietudeâ€”
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
Seductive, animated, bright,
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
See, I can hardly crawl aboutâ€”
Seeing in this no deprivation,
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
Seek the forgotten countenance
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
(See the first canto if ye will),
Selfish nonentities around?
Serious endeavours to assure
Servant of God and brigadier,
Serve who could neither read nor write.
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
Shaking with serious air the head,
Shall I behold thee once again?â€â€”
â€œShall I proceed, or homeward flee?
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Shall abdicate the bardâ€™s profession,
Shall my declining years beguile;
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
â€œShall we commence?â€â€”â€œLet it be so,â€
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
She bows her head beneath the crown;
She brought with her the gift of song.
She buries deep within her breast
She calm and unconcerned appears.
She cannotâ€”Eugene oped the door
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
She cannotâ€”then impatiently
She comprehends. The simple maid
She comprehends. The simple maid
She consolation thence obtainedâ€”
She could not sleep in her new bed.
She deemed its outline might afford.
She did not think â€œprocrastination
She dreamt she journeyed oâ€™er a field
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
She enters a deserted yardâ€”
She fears and like an arrow rushes
She fears she cannot.â€”Cannot? Why?â€”
She found herself alone at last,
She from the winter corn espies
She gazedâ€”a cue, forgotten long,
She gazed around herâ€”it was day.
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
She got a book of nursery tales,
She heard of servant-maids the note,
She hears of conversation nought
She hears the bear behind her press,
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
She hesitates, in doubt is thrownâ€”
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She is an angel! We sometime
She led me through nocturnal mist
She leisurely away doth ride,
She loved upon the balcony
She mourned and to the moon would raise
She murmurs in an undertone
She muses: â€œWhat was Olgaâ€™s fate?
She neâ€™er repeated unto hers.
She nerves herself from her alarm
She never more his face may view,
She never of deception dreamed
She on the apparition gazed,
She oped her eyes and cried: â€™tis he!
She peeped through a chink of the door.
She promised Eugene, or she would
She roseâ€”departed. But Eugene
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
She sank.â€”â€œHeâ€™s here! Eugene is here!
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
She seeks the garden in her needâ€”
She seemed of him oblivious,
She sits aloneâ€”â€™tis ever _she!_
She soon forgot, began to call
She starts, nor doth a word express,
She starts, nor doth a word express,
She strains her throat to force a cryâ€”
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
She, than the morning moon more pale,
She the acquaintances she loves,
She the delicious novel reads,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
She visited the humble tents
She waited forâ€”I donâ€™t know whom!
She waits, on fire her trembling frameâ€”
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
She was as heedless and as gayâ€”
She was thus fond of Richardson
â€œShe who with melancholy face
She will not see, she will not hear.
She wore her corset tightly bound,
She would pronounce _Ã  la FranÃ§aise_;
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
Shines in the female firmament
Shone pungent Satireâ€™s dauntless king,
Should be respected throughout life
Should dearly like a dance again.
Should go, the market for a maid,
Should make me much more circumspect,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
Shouts, laughter, jamming â€™gainst the wall,
Shouts of applause! OnÃ©guine passes
Shrill sang the _samovar_ at eve,
Shy, silent did the maid appear
Sickness more courage doth command
Sighs on another than her lord
Silent, oracular yeâ€™d see him
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
Silvers the brook; the shepherdâ€™s horn
Simeon PetrÃ²vitch just as shabby;
Similar dames ye may have seen.
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Since Eugene in that solitude
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Since I beheld Eugene and young
Since in these arms I thee did bearâ€”
Since leisure was together spent,
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
Singing God knows what maid admired,
Singing in chorus all the while.
Singing inside her hut the maid
â€œSit down. How funny, to be sure!
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Sits down and gazes on all sidesâ€”
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Slept oâ€™er the river misty grown.
Slow circling round its fellow swings
Slowly exhausted by desire,
Slumber still oâ€™er him lingering flies.
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
So Tania to her heartâ€™s content
So ancient warriors, battles oâ€™er,
So ardently did I desire
So be it! Just the laws which bid
Society endures not such!
Society he duped enow.â€
Society renounced once more.
So frequently his mind would stray
So from the mountain lazily
So full of piety, correct,
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
So inaccessible to men,
So irremissible appear?
So let us to the ball-room haste,
So many neighbours here existâ€”
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
Some Russian authors he perusedâ€”
Some a mazurka occupies,
So meantime let him joyous live
Some are afar and some are dead.
Some army poet therein may
Some day Iâ€™ll somehow finish it.
Some future ignoramus shall
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
Some marriageable maids behold,
Some nice instructive novel read,
Some one or other editor
Some other long-departed Spring,
Sometime collected, shall relate
Sometimes by pleasing flatteryâ€™s art,
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
Some wretched journal in his hand;
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruitâ€”
Soon Olgaâ€™s accents shrill resound
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
So prudent, and so circumspect
Sorrow to counterfeit and wailâ€”
So she her silken sash unlaced,
So she in French herself expressed.
So there will be a dance to-night.
â€œSo thou art wed! I did not know.
(So â€™twas with us in former years,
So uncongenial to my mind,
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
So, when he came next day to call,
Spanned the unbridled torrent oâ€™er;
Spared him not their asperities.
Spare yourself unavailing pain
Spectacles upon nose, all day
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
Speech was so tame and colourless
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
Spite of herself with Lenskiâ€™s lot
Spoiled children most degenerate
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
Springâ€™s paramour, pours forth her song
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
Sterner solicitudes engage,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Still certain authors, I may add,
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
Still everywhere, without, within,
Still happier he who neâ€™er hath known!
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
Still of his club he member wasâ€”
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
Straight for the entrance then he made
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
Straight from their province had he come?â€â€”
Strange unto her each childish game,
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
Strictly the Carnival observed,
Striking the intellect with awe
Struck Lenski deadâ€”across the scene
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl oâ€™er.
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Submissive as if in a swoon,
Subscribed, _toujours Ã  vous, Annette;_
Successfully to please her tried,
Such am I. This did ye expect,
Such is the country custom good;
Such open-hearted innocence.
Such was OnÃ©guineâ€™s sainted life,
Such were the musings of Eugene.
Suddenly to the left hand side,
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
Surely ye all have overhauled
(Surely you know him as I speak);
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Swift following in her wake, the sun,â€
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
Take to their wings and fly away.
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Tania doth by the casement linger
â€œTania, my eldest child, you knowâ€â€”
Tania, observed by nobody,
Tania the meaning would obtain
Tania well nigh expired when he
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quickâ€”
Tattiana by a poor auntâ€™s side,
Tattiana certainly infers
Tattiana courage doth regain
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
Tattiana every day conferred
Tattiana faltered, and became
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
Tattiana from the hill descends
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
Tattiana gently led them there.
Tattiana in a misty dream,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Tattiana in the yard appears
Tattiana in the young princess!
Tattiana in the young princess!
Tattiana in traditions old
Tattiana learns the intelligenceâ€”
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Tattiana more than ever burned
Tattiana motionless abides.
Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
Tattiana oâ€™er the stream complained;
Tattiana purchased with a stray
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?â€â€”
Tattiana saw with trepidation
Tattianaâ€™s beauty, pale with care,
Tattianaâ€™s eyes with tender gleam
Tattianaâ€™s letter I possess,
Tattianaâ€™s love was quite sincere,
Tattianaâ€™s trouble might have spied,
Tattiana suffered secretly;
Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
Tattiana terrified awoke.
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Tattianaâ€”thus the sex is born.â€”
Tattiana to a corner, bids
Tattiana to the index flies
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Tattiana was her appellation.
Tattiana with impatience waited
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Tattiana would have gladly heard
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
â€œTell me, why doth your comrade stay?â€
Tender and elevated, free?
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
Terpsichore alone among
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
Terror assails her. Hastily
Terror of guardians of the night;
Than cold OnÃ©guineâ€™s oddities,
Than health, so with a trembling hand
Than oneâ€™s own fascinating self.
That Heaven her character had blent
That I am rich, a princeâ€™s wife?â€”
That I am rich, a princeâ€™s wife?â€”
That I forget not whom I sing.
That Ninaâ€™s marble symmetry,
That a friendâ€™s arm in every case
That afterwards with evil smile
That all may hear his voiceâ€™s tone.
That bilberry wine, Iâ€™m sore afraid,
That certain volumes she might read.
That chosen heroes consecrate,
That crass stupidity misleads,
That every morn at Verreyâ€™s cost
That first the Muse appeared to me.
That for that matter in my verse
That, for the century designed,
That girlâ€”but he must dreaming beâ€”
That girl whom once on a time he
That grandmothers and grandsires may
That guests approach: and when above
That heart with inspiration sweet
That hero, though his merit shone,
That he was â€œready any day.â€
That is, he could elucidate
That like a friendly voice its tone
That mediocrity alone
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
That my dishonour would ensure
That my dishonour would ensure
That our desires which noblest seemed,
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
That the two friends with morningâ€™s light
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
That until Christmas comes again
That vanished are my youthful days
That vicious set whom I donâ€™t blameâ€”
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
That we her constantly betrayed
That year the autumn season late
That youthful heartâ€”â€œBut, now at least,
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
The German baker looks around
The God of Love is after you!
â€œThe Lord be with thee, O my daughter!â€â€”
The Lord deliver her and save!
The Lovelaces are out of date,
The LÃ rinas unwisely went,
The LÃ rinas were since sunrise
The LÃ rinas would celebrate,
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
The Muse abandoned, taâ€™en a wife,
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
The Muse capricious let us coax,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
The Nevaâ€™s Cleopatra, and
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
The Paris of those country parts
The Princess N. will be at home
The Russian N with nasal sound
The Russian language I deem vile
The Russian winter did adore
The accents wild of otherâ€™s woes,
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
The aged nurse in ample gown,
The aged woman in her woe:
The all-entrancing joys of loveâ€”
The altar flame was quenched in night.
The amatory science warm,
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
The artful prisoner should seek
The aspect of a landscape drear.
The avalanche of snow first bends,
The ball in all its splendour shone.
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
The bard his answer waits at home,
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
The bardâ€™s enthusiastic strain,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
The bays of age and helplessness.
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
The bee forth from his cell of wax
The beldam saith: â€œThe hearth, by it
The blessings of humanity.
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
The body they consigned to rest,
The boy was wild but full of grace.
The break of day she doth not see,
The breath of Spring again renewed,
The bridegroom sage without delay
The bridge and alley to the lake,
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
The butt of scandal having been,
The calm existence which I prize
The captain of a company.
The captives of the Salguirâ€™s shore.
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
The chaise long ordered please employ,
The channel of the river stilled
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
The child of sloth and liberty.
The china teapot too ye might
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
The clue unto some mystery
The coach before a house stood still.
The coach is borne oâ€™er ruts and holes,
The cold reply with gloomy mien
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
The coming of lifeâ€™s Autumn drear.
The company deep silence guard.
The comrade of your youth should strike,
The connoisseur his glances throws
The contact of the foot I raised
The conversation tedious
The conversation was revived
The converse of our hermits twain,
The converse of the world polite,
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
The counsel good and full of reason,
The country hath its liberties
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
The crash of music, candlesâ€™ glare
The credulous indeed are blest,
The crowd and merriment and light,
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
The crystals of her vestibule
The curs away to kennel chase,
The curse of commonplace delight.
The curtain now they slowly raise.
The cynosure of every eye.
The damsel under escort place.
â€œ_The date, his fleeting years how longâ€”
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
The days of love and of romance!
The days which to your youth belong?
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
The deuce with my inside has played.â€
The disenchanted glass direct
The door flew openâ€”Olga came,
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The drama of my youth was played.
The dream left terror in its train.
The drive becomes monotonousâ€”
The drum already doth arouse.
The dusty chronicles of earth
The early days of life we sought.
The early tinkling of the bells
The easier â€™tis to gain her grace,
Thee but a little space bewept,
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
The epistle from the bard presents.
The epitaph on marble shows:
The evanescent fashions fly
The excited hero in a trice
The eyes of a grave general.
The fair, nor parted with regret,
The fair of the next generation,
â€œThe family are all quite wellâ€”
The family of Kharlikoff,
The family of children hie.
The fashionable rhymesterâ€™s heart!
The fatal bullet penetrate,
The fatal hour had come at lastâ€”
The fatal secrets of the grave,
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
The fated nutriment desired;
The father scarcely understands
The feeble moment would espy
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The feet of my dear lady friends.
The fervid poet would recite,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
The fires of passion and its smartâ€”
The firmament in mellow light,
The first appearance of the snows
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
The fisherâ€™s fire afar illumes
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
The forests in mysterious gloom
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
The freshness of her heart impair,
The friend of liberty and laws
The friends are called and quickly placed.
The fruits of learning and combined
The fruits of science, evil, good,
The general who accompanies.
The giddy world at last shall see.
The gifted songster never swerved,
The gilding of lifeâ€™s vanities,
The girl in marriage they unite.
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
The glass unwittingly inspect
The goblet still is bubbling brightâ€”
The goddess would a masquerade
The golden ember now enshrines,
The gossip of their ladies fair.
The guests make room; aside each takes
The gulf between them was so vast,
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
The happiest days of life employ?
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
The hero is of my narration!
The heroâ€™s name too in advance,
The hero we immortalize.
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
The horizon luminous doth grow,
The hostess doth interrogate:
The hours once more OnÃ©guine counts,
The hour whenâ€”Fate so willedâ€”we met
The hour whenâ€”Fate so willedâ€”we met
The house and garden I would see.â€
The household property contain:
The household troop of little boys,
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
The husband comes and interferes
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
The idols of their adoration
The image of her seal impressed.
The imagination to enliven
The indignation of her heart!
The inmate is for ever dumb,
The â€œin memoriamâ€ pages sought,
The inscription oâ€™er the gates of Hell
The insensate fire of love still glowed
Their Jealousy and separation
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
Their claims and explanations shout.
Their coming which no man expects,
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
Their giddy sports she neâ€™er enjoyed.
Their glory with their heels of red
Their harmless conversation blends
Their heroes used to represent
Their idols they were wont to invest
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
Their memory lingers still and seems
Their natural attractions lend
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Their offspringâ€™s innocent flirtations
Their own productions, some insist
Their privileged allurements fire
Their slander eâ€™en was weariness;
Their voices nought to her impart
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
The kennel or a kindred line,
The ladiesâ€™ dresses airy, light,
The ladiesâ€™ laughter to provoke.
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
The lady in the crimson cap
The ladyâ€™s glance upon him fellâ€”
The lamps illuminating shine;
The lancer, to his calling bound,
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
The language of her girlish pleading
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
The languid mind could smile at nought,
The last poor obol I was worthâ€”
The laws of generations past,
â€œThe left? Why, what on earth is there?â€â€”
The less we love a lady fair
The letter is the thing, you see,â€”
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
The lilyâ€™s stem to eat away,
The limits of enlightenment
The little solitary nook
The lively trash of stories long
The lonely mansion-house to screen
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
The maiden at her casement sits
The maidenâ€™s weary eye which yearned,
The maids beside Tattiana keepâ€”
The maid whose note he still possessed
The malady of hopeless love
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
The man and liked his company,
The manly toga scarce assumed,
The manners of the highest class
The master always used to sit.
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
The matter by his conscience tried,
The matter did not agitate,
The medium is required of gold.
The memory of the bard, a dream,
The memory of the bard was driven
The men salute with lower bows
The military band will play.
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
The miserable bard to meet,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
The moderns of the ancients raveâ€”
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
The monsters of the British Muse
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
The moon, the stars, and shining nightâ€”
The morn arises foggy, cold,
The most industrious man alive
The motley moving mass and bright,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
The mystic lines to tear away
The mystic monogram, O. E.
Then, I say truly, none but thee
â€œThen amongst strangers I was leftâ€”
The native Russian tongue impeach?
The natural fickleness of passion,
Then became busy with the house,
â€œThen come with me.â€ The prince proceeds,
Then dressed himself...
The needle nor, oâ€™er framework bent,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
The new moonâ€™s crescent slim she spied,
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
Then glittering in the sun descends.
Then handed her the song with grace.
Then heâ€™d malign them secretly
Then, her distraction to allay,
The nightingale there all night long,
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
The nights of golden Italy
â€œThen, in the country, isâ€™t not true?
â€œThen, in the country, isâ€™t not true?
Then in the silent cabinet
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Then my companions young with pleasure
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
â€œThen send your grandson quietly
Then suddenly discharge a joke
Then, the far capital forgot,
Then, thenâ€”well, in some solitude
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
Then they came easily enow,
Then theyâ€™re so innocent of vice,
Then to reward such confidence
Then to some gallant in your turn
Then touching Olga they depart
Then weeping she sank back distressed
Then would we muse as in a trance,
Then ye were barely generous,
The old Derjavine noticed me,
The olden time shall be my theme.
The old man who has had his freaks,
The opportunity is flown.
The pains of night have wholly fled,
The pall of night was growing thin,
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
The passionate speeches Iâ€™ll repeat,
The path of hope and tender fearâ€”
The path which leads to gloryâ€™s goal.
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
_The peasants there are rich as kings,
The perfidies I recollect
The pervert world with icy chill
The pile of books, with carpet spread
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
The poet fell; already men
The poet from Tamboff secured,
The poet, modest though so grand,
The poetâ€™s fervid conversation
The poetâ€™s hour hath soundedâ€”See!
The poetâ€™s madness? for â€™tis hard
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
The poor girl fell into a faint,
â€œThe post hath kept him, it is like.â€
The powder in the pan is laid,
The prejudices all men have,
The princeâ€™s eye OnÃ©guine seeks:
The princess from the sofa cried
The proud ones are not worth the fire
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
There Didelot became glorious,
There an imperious skeleton;
There, aping Gulnareâ€™s bard, he spanned
The reaping girls approach and ply
There came a sudden flash of light,
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
There friends of pure delight had been
There, in that knot of company,
There is a spot the village near
There is no fishmarket retort
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
There is no stupid calumny
There is no wreath upon the bough:
There jars of cider block the way,
Thereâ€™ll be a fight. I do not lie.
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
Thereon the passing traveller read:
There our KatÃ¨nine did revive
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
There, there, beneath the side-sceneâ€™s shade
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
There was no angling for success.
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
There, when the rains of spring we mark
The rigour of cold pride and all
The riot of the world and glare
The riverâ€™s bank. Tattiana lone
The river through the linden wood.
The room my former master used.
The ruts of his own fatherland.
The sad moon only could remark.
The same unmoved oblivion
The same warm vision constantly;
These are your relatives, believe:
The secrets of the marriage state
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
These evenings as in days of old
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
The serpent to unlawful trees
The servants used to congregate
These take their seats; the coach of state
These to the coach of state are bound,
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
The sharp incisions of his nail,
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
The shining orbs of night appear;
The shining pistols are uncased,
The shining river clothed in ice;
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The shutters open; to the skies
The silent fields no peasant nears,
The simple epitaphâ€”a tear
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
The sneers of critics superfine;
The snow descends and buries all,
The snows from off the hills around
The snow upon the streets doth meltâ€”
The solstice of our earthly years,
The sorrows of a single state.
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
The starry beacons fade away,
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
The steward sent a note to tell
The stomach doth admonish us.
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
The story of his young loveâ€™s dream,
The story of thy life and fate.
The strange apartment her oppressed:
The strife grew furious and Eugene
The style in which my hero dressed;
The style of wise antiquity.
The sudden rattling of a car.
The sun had mounted high his steep,
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
The table with its lamp unlit,
The tale of these romantic men;
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
The thirst for fame and manâ€™s applause,
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
The time between the wolf and dogsâ€”
The time for mystic strolls which late
The time when Melancholyâ€™s claw
The tiny sun shone less on high
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
The torment born of crime unseen,
The torrent of opinion,
The traveller, bird of passage he,
The trees in silvery array,
The triumph of a conquest new.
The troop of apparitions fled,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
The twilight pale which softens all,
The two friendsâ€™ compliments she hears
The two old ladies then embraced
The unaffected traits she now
The unbidden guests he roughly chidesâ€”
The uncontaminated kiss
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
The venerable dame opined
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
The very morning of our days.
The vestibule finds empty quiteâ€”
The vile seducer shall not dare
The village wherein yawned Eugene
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
The votary of vain delight
The weary way still incomplete,
The wedding-day had been arranged,
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
The windows whitened, shutters closeâ€”
The wind rose instantly, blew out
The witching light of sympathy;
The wit of others to acquire.
The wolf upon the highways bold
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
The wood she entersâ€”bear behind,â€”
The woods, still naked to the view,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
The words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
The workpeople she superintended,
The works of Mr. Richardson.
The world enough. Congratulate
The world is ever altering!
They are all natural and low,
They blossom, ripen and they fall
They crack a feeble joke and smileâ€”
They deem her somewhat finical,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
They first of all my brow did wreathe
They growl a bitâ€”they scandaliseâ€”
They hand in hand to table go.
They have invited you this week.â€
They in a peaceful life preserved
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
They long ago had held debate.
They long at home have her expectedâ€”
They made him feel inclined to doze;
They may forget that we exist.
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
The young Simeonova too there
â€œThe younger, youâ€™re in love with her!â€
The young proprietor we find;
The youthful lover once again
The youthful poetâ€™s fond confession.
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
They sat, but conversationâ€™s flow
They sent their complimentsâ€”but oh!
They shout and no one lists at all.
They shovel silver with a spade,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
They were the wonderful traditions
They will receive us with delight.â€
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
They would not solemnly debate
Thinking: â€™tis foolish to disturb
Thinking to float upon the stream,
This anchorite amid his waste
(This by command; for it was found,
This evanescent boyish bliss.
This gentle daring who could guess?
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
This great discovery relief
This he believed: a kindred spirit
This is my masterâ€™s sitting-room.
(This joking I used to protest),
This life in masquerade concealed,
This lot in life with stern decree?
This monument of thought profound
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
This northern summer of our own,
This was his social character.
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
This world. I do not praise desire,
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Thither in future to proceed
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Thou also, my ideal true,
Thou also, reader generous,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
Though Baratynski verses penned,
Though, God be praised! he neâ€™er designed
Though I confess I hardly dare
Though Iâ€™ll return to him right early,
Though around honoured Priamâ€™s throne
Though beauty he no more adored,
Though by an error and unsoughtâ€”
(Though certainly mankind he knew
Though correspondence as a rule
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
Though for his Helen Menelaus
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Though hitherto a lady neâ€™er
Though late, have a beginning made.
Though now my love might be intense,
Though of romance therein I fail
Though scarcely following what was said,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Though superannuated rather;
Though the foul vision promise made
Though to the Academy I come
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
Though we will not acknowledge it.
Though without palaces and streets,
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Thouâ€™lt quaff loveâ€™s sweet envenomed stream,
Thouâ€™lt suffer, dearest, but before,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
Three mortal hours per diem he
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Thrice happy who their agonies
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
Through dense aristocratic rows
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
Thus age approached, the common doom,
Thus a guest with composure will
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Thus did our friend OnÃ©guine preach:
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
Thus having braved Apolloâ€™s rage
Thus her perversity hath shown.
Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,
Thus in the earth the seed expands
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
Thus oftâ€”this I myself confessâ€”
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
Thus to assassinate the eve?â€â€”
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
Thus we began our little taleâ€”
Thus widely meditation erred,
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!â€
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
Thy meditative incantationâ€”
Till January fell no snowâ€”
Till absently Vladimir took
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
Till mornâ€”life uniform but gay,
Till out of breath upon a seat
Till proper rings could be procured.
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
Till the mazurkaâ€™s close he stays,
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Time-honoured Kremlinâ€™s keys present.
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
Time was, a valiant general might
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Time was, in style magniloquent
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
Time was, the poetâ€™s tender quill
Time was, two maidens from their home
Time was when cold seduction strove
Time will the ravages effaceâ€”
Time without me will lessons give,
Tired by the ballâ€™s incessant noise,
Tiresome unto her hath become
â€™Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
â€™Tis a scene of romance, I vow!â€
â€™Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
â€™Tis day, the family downstairs,
â€™Tis done. To supper they proceed.
â€™Tis dreadfulâ€”ye agree, I hopeâ€”
â€™Tis evidently Heavenâ€™s will
â€™Tis fearful to anticipate
â€™Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
â€œâ€™Tis habit, Lenski.â€â€”â€œIs your ill
â€™Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
â€™Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
â€™Tis noisome to her there: in thought
â€™Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
â€™Tis now the hillock now the rill
â€™Tis now the season! Idlers all,
â€™Tis silent all! Alone the cries
â€™Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
â€™Tis silentâ€”on her shines the moonâ€”
â€™Tis something of this sort I deem.
â€™Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
â€™Tis there that arrant fops display
â€™Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
â€™Tis time for supper, now for bed,
â€œâ€™Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
â€™Tis time she to the altar went!
â€œâ€™Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
â€™Tis time to marry her, â€™tis true,
â€™Tis time to quit this weary shore
â€™Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_â€
Titles and ages intermixed.
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
To Eve the universal mother,
To God eternal hymns of praise.
To Love all ages lowly bend,
â€œToâ€”?â€â€”â€œLÃ rina.â€â€”â€œTattiana?â€â€”â€œSo.
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
To Olga frequently he would
To Russ indigenous are not;
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
To accompany him and to escort
To agitate me in my dreams.
To all good neighboursâ€™ sport conduced.
To all she answers cruellyâ€”
To an assemblyâ€”she appeared
To anticipate the break of day,
To arid selfishness resigned,
To array himself in evening dress.
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
To ask her name the trouble took.
To a surrender gave consent,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
To banish far unworthy themes
To be a charming mystery:
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
To bring behind: the triple steeds
To captivate her how devoted!
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
To clank the spur, delight the fairâ€”
To classicism Iâ€™ve homage paid,
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
To consanguineous dinners they
To cool the cutletsâ€™ seething grease,
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
To-day it is my turn to teach.
To-day it is my turn to teach.
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
To dire contentment shall give birth
To dominate her worthy lord,
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
To dream upon the sunny strand
To end with him her path below.
To fawn upon and love express;
To find in gossip such delight,
To flight before her radiant look,
To foreign lands he would allude,
To freeze his finger hath begun,
To friendship making no pretence,
Together moments one or two
Together they returned, nor word
Together we have wandered oâ€™er
To guess how you the eve pull through.â€â€”
To happiness contributing.
To help her to the other shore
To her an elegy composed.
To his Penates now returned,
To idle musing was a prey;
To jest as he had done last eve,
To kiss the feet which I admired!
To labour in his sledge forgot,
To lawless love I should preferâ€”
To lawless love I should preferâ€”
To lay two covers secretly.
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
To light had brought them from their dust,
To listen to the rippling rill.
To loiter there in idleness
To look on life as on a show,
To make wise men the idiot play
To male acquaintances he bows,
To many a noisy feast and fight,
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
To me he would his Olga give,
To mention the foregoing eve,
Tome of â€œMalvina,â€ and but three
To-morrow Tania we will show,
To-morrow before break of day,
To-morrow just like yesterday.
â€œTo-morrowâ€™s dawn will glimmer gray,
To move in fashionable life,
To move in fashionable life,
To mutter her concealed desire
To my old nurse alone peruse,
Took aimâ€”but as immediately
Too much Iâ€™m given to intersperse,
To our Tattiana conquering,
To part in amity with thee!
To pass the night at home hath gone.
To pass with reasonable men
To peer into the future tries.
To purest love he tuned his note
To raise a clamour and a din:
To raise his pistol to his eye,
To romp and play she neâ€™er would go:
Torquato Tassoâ€™s strains I deem.
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
To russify the foreign phrase
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
To see aughtâ€”never mind meanwhile)
To see his Olga ere the frayâ€”
To seek him out with bended head.
To shallow sentiment a slave!
To sigh and meditate alone:
To sketch myself that I have tried
To sketch ye in Albanoâ€™s style.
To slay himself with blade or ball,
To standards in which we believe?
To stay the maid against her will.
To strike imagination serve.
To suchâ€”delightful to repel.
To swagger as the art of love,
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
To take a hand at whist oft come:
To take this letter to Oâ€” Well!
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
To the assembly her they bear.
To the fair object of his dream,
To the impressions of our youth,
To the pianoforte he moves
To the sarcastic observation,
To the theatre he repairs
To the young girl he said adieu,
To the youth Eugene hurried nowâ€”
To this arrangement can be seen,
To thy decree my will I bend.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
To treat the matter as a jest,
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
To understand by slow degrees
To vary for a few brief days.
To visit Moscow in the season.
To visit, lovely maid, return,
To wander through the meadows still,
To whom amongst the jealous throng
To whom are our misfortunes grief
â€œTo whom is it to go, my sweet?
To whom we used to consecrate
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
To whom your hearts were consecrate,â€”
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
To write his forefathers to warn
To write in cantos twenty-five.
To write of any other elf
To youthful Olgaâ€™s beauty bright,
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
Transfixed OnÃ©guine mine doth stay.
Transparent oâ€™er the Neva beamed
Transported to our Russian clime.
Trembles at artificial shame.
Trembles upon my lips from spite,â€”
Trembling he seeks the young princessâ€”
Triquet arose, and for the bard
Triumphant by anticipation,
Triumphant with the answer come.
Triumphsâ€”their own or those of friendsâ€”
Troyâ€™s sages should in concert own
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Turned and replied as it behoved,
Turned to her and discordantly
â€™Twas built, the venerable pile,
â€™Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
â€™Twas eve. â€™Twas dusk. The river speeds
â€™Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
â€™Twas not the first time, I can tell
â€™Twas plainâ€”an oaken floor ye scan,
â€œâ€™Twas possible then, happinessâ€”
â€™Twas she who first within his breast
â€™Twas then he loved the tangled grove
â€™Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
â€™Twas these he read and these alone
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
Two dressed in uniform appearâ€”
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
Two hearts perchance were desolate
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
Two poles together glued by ice,
â€™Twould serve ye in an epigramâ€”
Two verses he could recollect
Undeviating and insane
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Undressed herself and went to bed
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Unfavourable unto her.
Unhappily too salt by far;
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Unknown to all he doth appear,
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Until her heart less high should boundâ€”
Until her powers of running fail.
Until the sleepless BrÃ©guet chime
Unto Anicia for the keys
Unto a carping world must showâ€”
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
Unto her husband, went awayâ€”
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Unto his own Tattiana he,
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tellâ€”
Unto the fields she makes her way,
Unto the gates the servants fly
Unto the hero of this lay
Unto their solitude one day,
Unto the sounding sea to list,
Unto the windmill he must ride
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?â€”
Upon her brow sits wrath aloneâ€”
Upon her cheek by adulation
Upon her elbow she reclines,
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
Upon his couch insensibly;
Upon its damp opacity,
Upon my lake I love to float,
Upon my visions such intrude.
Upon the Donâ€™s broad pastures bred
Upon the ball-roomâ€™s glassy floor
Upon the dreary northern snows,
Upon the earth a mist did lie
Upon the highway of the sea
Upon the meadows showering,
Upon the opening page ye find:
Upon the stage his weary glance.
Upon the table in a trice
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Upon the windows tracery,
Upon those margins she perceived
Upon those pages she descries
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
Up to the attic, and all need
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
Urging your droshkies swift as air
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
Us from the world wherein we live.
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Variety of speech and vests,
Verses and tears et cetera.
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Vice in romance is glorified
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
Villages in the distance show
Virgins miraculous I see,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
â€œ_Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
Vladimir Lenski visited
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
Vladimir closes up his book,
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
Vladimir something curtly said
Vladimirâ€™s property, a man
Vociferously paid her court,
Voices and hands applaud, and she
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Vows matrimonial to break,
Wafted upon poetic wing,
Waiting his comingâ€”his alone!
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
Wallow, my friends, in company!
â€œWarm yourself here a little space!â€
Was a delightful little spot,
Was born beside the Neva, where
Was certainly no Grandison.
Was certainly not erudite
Was drawn, ideal of my layâ€”
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Was he in health and void of care?â€”
Was it not so?â€”for thee I gave,
Was nothing but the British spleen
Was not surprised thereby at all.
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
Was that which we are wont to call
Was the first question Olga made,
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Was the old and forgotten coach;
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Was uttered, and the cabin shookâ€”
Was withered ere the morning lightâ€”
Was with himself dissatisfied.
Was wont with me at cards to play.
Was worthy of that old baboon,
Was younger than myself, my light,
We Russians, friends from distant parts
We all of us of education
We are the first who such a name
Wearied of leisure in the end,
We called to mind our youthful daysâ€”
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
We glide along a floor of wax.
We hear with interest intense
â€œWell!â€â€”â€œI the elder should prefer,
Well! LÃ rina appears to us
Well, if your pistol ball by chance
Well! just as she was yesterday.
Well known unto OnÃ©guine mine.
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
We must admit but little taste
â€œWe never loved in days of old,
Were I like you a bard by tradeâ€”
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
Were to analysis subjected.
Were you in love when you were young?â€â€”
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
We visit about Christmas Day,
â€œWhat! Grandison?â€â€”â€œYes, certainly!â€
What I by relatives conceive?
What agitation languidly
â€œWhat ails thee?â€â€”â€œNothing.â€â€”He is fled.
â€œWhat ails thee, dear?â€â€”â€œI feel depressed.
What are they? Gladly would I yield
What a storm of emotions keen
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
What boots it with the age to strive?
â€œWhat can be done? She is no child!â€
â€œWhat can be drearier than the house,
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
What doth she see? Around the board
What everybody long has known;
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
What, invitations? The same day
What is his latest character?
What is thy cleverness to me?
â€œWhat is your name?â€ The boor looked dazed,
What jokes and guesses now abound,
What languor would his silence show,
What moreâ€™s required? The world replies,
What never was remarked or heard
What once I knew is clean forgotâ€”
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
What! really going? â€™Tis too bad!
What sad emotions oâ€™er me steal
What say you? to the familyâ€”
What they in conversation said?â€”
What visions then her fancy throngedâ€”
What visions then her fancy throngedâ€”
What will the coming dawn reveal?
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
When I yon semicircle bright
When Passionâ€™s fire no longer glows
When all around the entrance pressed,
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
When but a boy he Olga loved
When captured in a schoolboyâ€™s cap;
When deaf and silent he doth lie
Wheneâ€™er a brilliant courtly dame
Wheneâ€™er across the plain at speed
Wheneâ€™er he had an aching head;
When evening oâ€™er the landscape looms,
When first upon my cheek I feel
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
When he in ardent verse portrays
When hopeâ€™s delightful flower but bloomed
When in as instant she is lost,â€”
When in her walks abroad she met
When in simplicity ye wrote
When in that company she saw
When in the grand saloon was heard
When in the studyâ€™s calm retreat,
When motionless your gaze beneath
When oâ€™er a glass with friends we prate
When on the pallid eastern sky
When people with long countenance
When poets lachrymose recite
When separationâ€™s hour drew nigh,
When shall I wing my passage free
When, sitting by his fire alone
When tea was brought. â€™Tis my delight
When that time comes, a poem Iâ€™ll strive
When the hour came to bid good-byeâ€”
When the mazurka used to peal,
When the obedient doll in sport
When the same life before him lies
When the sonorous BrÃ©guet tells
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
When, where, and in what desert land,
When will my hour of freedom come!
When will the devil take his own!â€
When, wise at length, we seek repose
When youthâ€™s rebellious hour drew near
Where God alone knows whom she met.
Where I can no more recollect?â€”
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
Whereâ€”â€â€”â€œWhat! another eclogue spin?
Where all upon the surface lies,â€”
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Where dwelt the Musesâ€™ worshipper,
Where each young critic ready stands,
Where every day before his eyes
Where fashionable circles meet
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Wherefore am I your quarry held?â€”
Wherefore am I your quarry held?â€”
Wherefore regarding him express
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
Wherein I buried left my heart.
Wherein I castigation get;
Wherein I felt loveâ€™s fatal dart,
Wherein a space OnÃ©guine spent.
Wherein love innocently pines.
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
Wherein the miserable wife
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Where is OnÃ©guine? Half asleep,
Where is he who doth not deceive?
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
Where long time he in solitude
Where many another hand had signed
Where melancholy rocks arise
Where my days in the wilderness
Where plentifully feelings flow
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
Where the first time I saw your face,â€”
Where the first time she met with _him_.
Whereto in language courteous
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Which afterwards the muse revived.
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Which from the devilâ€™s bookcase start,
Which glowed with virginal desire.
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
Which in the elevated sphere
Which in the winter were a joy:
Which in your spirit dominates,
Which is he? or an imitation,
Which lessons unto us repeat,
Which might for many ages last.
Which â€™neath her pillow lay till morn.
Which never have existed, eâ€™en
Which oâ€™er the waters boldly leap,
Which of approaching labour tells
Which rankled in Tattianaâ€™s breast,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Which shines with iridescent hues.
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
Which we experienced long ago.
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
Whilst from her countenance neâ€™er stirred
Whilst he â€œbelle Ninaâ€ had the face
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
Whilst the fond parents, friends throâ€™ life,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Whither along them doth he pelt?
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Whither at headlong speed doth go
â€œWhither away? Deuce take the bard!â€â€”
Whither departed is the host?
Whither shall he go first? Heâ€™ll see,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
Whither that evening he will go.
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
â€œWho? Is it that stout general, pray?â€â€”
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
Who by a haughty word or glance
Who cannot conjure former joys?
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
Who early died a gallant death_,â€
Who every gesture, every phrase
Who floats contentedly through life,
Who following Petrarch move along
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Who had for four long years survived
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Who in the agony of grief
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
_Who in thy love finds more delight
Who knows? with loveâ€™s consuming flame
Who labours hard to humour us?
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Whom, as the custom is of men,
Whom autocratic fateâ€™s decrees
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
Whom latterly one often meets
Whom pale Dianaâ€™s ray illumesâ€”
Whom thirty centuries adore.
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Whom you in slumber may have seen.â€
Who now could fail to recognize
Who now could fail to recognize
Who reads his visionary theme
Whose author nature understood
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
Whose hands indulgently caress
Whose heart experience icy made
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
Whose memory doth not refuse
Whose qualities appeared to afford
Whose tones Apolloâ€™s sons inspire,
Who the romance do not complete,
Who the romance do not complete,
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
Who thrives this moment as I write,
Who to surrender did not blench
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
â€œWho will be there?â€â€”â€œThe family.
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Who without more prevarication
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?â€â€”
Who words and actions will adjust
â€œWho would have thought it? As of yore!
Who would the maiden innocent
â€œWhy, as God ordered! My Ivan
â€œWhy did you leave last night so soon?â€
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?â€”
Will be absorbed by Letheâ€™s stream;
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
Will he pursue?â€”But no one came.
Will not five centuries exceed
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
Will pass; the same to-morrow tryâ€”
Will teach grammatical conceits,
Will to the old times faithful be.
Will you?â€â€”â€œAgreed.â€â€”â€œI thank you, friend,â€
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
Winter resigned her empire white,
Winterâ€™s approach she doth not hail
With Eugene pranks of former years
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
With Olga; nor of this appeared
With Ozeroff was wont to share
With affectation,â€”nothing more.
With all dissatisfaction shows.
With all their progeny were there,
With an imagination wild,
With ardent sighs and flattery
With bated breath, around she bends
With better half as cumbersome;
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
With blessings on the ditches and
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
With book in hand reclined in bed,
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
With clouded brow stands silently?
With deeper woe than othersâ€™ grief.
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
With epigrams impertinent,
With eye precise and without fail.
With fir-trees standing motionless
With flame more ardent passion burns,
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
With gay design and silken stitch.
With great delight.â€”O God on high!
With her they did associate,
With him were friends eternally:
With his exasperated sense,
With his ferocious mate appears.
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
With hope and then perplexity,
With hopeless passion: from her bed
With humble prose Iâ€™ll fill my page
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
With inexact pronunciation
Within her; she is sick at heart;
Within his memory there lay,
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
Within its wave the sounding pail,
Within my memory I bore
Within resounded shriek and shout:
With intellect and strong volition
With intellect, a taste refined,
Within that secret court discussed,
With iridescent wing doth flap
With it may be a couple more;
With its exhilarating flow,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
With jealous fire resuscitate,
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
With laughter smothered weariness:
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
With little knowledge and that wrong
With loud explosion, the bright wine
With loversâ€™ rubbish filled, was neat
With love which happiness extends;
With many a snare their pathway line!
With many a vacancy, â€™tis said.â€â€”
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
With measured step and even gait
With mute appeal to ask they seemâ€”
With one foot resting on its tip
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
With our OnÃ©guine doth aspire
Without a chance to slip away.
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Without constraint in conversation
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Without disgust we look upon?
Without enthusiasm he met
Without grammatical mistakes.
Without participation hears,
Without profession, business, wife,
Without the faintest trace to leave
Without the ken of parents both,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Without them Eugene is complete;
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
With pungent or obtuse retort,
With purple hand Aurora leads,
With quite a lachrymose expression
With rapturous longing he awaits,
With roses, caps and looks malign;
With sad refrain misfortune near.
With satisfaction marvellous,
With scandalâ€™s trivial ornament.
With serious air then went away
With smiling face he Lenski hears;
With so much warmth and intellect?
With spiritual tenderness;
With such a perversity proclaim.
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
With taffety instead of crape.
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,â€”
With tears which secret sufferers loveâ€”
With tenderness hath recognized
With the â€œWell-Wisherâ€ in her hand!
With the epistle of my fair;
With this immoderate request
With this unpleasant _tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte_,
With thoughts of a far distant land,
With tranquil air OnÃ©guine leads
With tumult or contentment still
With unanimity complete,
With us is easily attained.
With us â€™tis quite a novelty
With â€œvaleâ€ finish off a note;
With what avidity and zest
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
With words of foreign origin
With worldly honours, it may be,
Would agitate a mystic wreath
Would at the proper time appear.
Would haste in agitation dire
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Would she in silence long remain.
Would she the canvas tight enrich
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
Would whisper: shall I so long live?â€â€”
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Writ in my honour now and thenâ€”
Yawning betook him to a pen.
Yea! although rendered beauteous
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
Ye billows of blue Hadriaâ€™s sea,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Ye feel but little interest,
Ye golden days of my young spring?
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Ye men of fashion cynical,
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
Ye mothers also, caution use,
Ye need dissimulation base
â€œYe peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
Yes! every one must have his foes,
Yes! for our unpretending home,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
Yes, happyâ€”though she at his side
Yet as a rule their talk I call
Yet clearer shines than every light
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
Yet let us part in friendship, O
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
Yet on a frosty winter day
Yet satiated with success,
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
Yet sometimes pages two or three
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Yet still apparently aspire
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
Yet still remains the old despair.
Yet suffering emotional
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
Yet was her inmost soul oâ€™erjoyed
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Yon silly moon upon the brink
You choose.â€â€”â€œBut who is she?â€â€”â€œMy wife.â€
You fall in love again. But stillâ€”
â€œYou have a letter to me sent.
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
You know that I am now a foolâ€”
Youâ€™ll find her portrait there, I vouch;
Youâ€™ll spend your winter famously!
You never since your nose have shown.
Young ladiesâ€™ faces and their feet.
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
You oâ€™er your wine insulted hathâ€”
Your conversation cold and hard,
Your conversation cold and hard,
â€œYour fashionable world I hate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Your innocent and charming note
Your magic voices I shall greet,
â€œYour second you have left behind!â€
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
Youth freshens beneath Passionâ€™s showers,
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
Zaretski shouted: â€œWhy, heâ€™s killed!â€â€”
Zaretski, village mechanician,
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
and with dishevelled hair,

Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Fair source of every fine idea,
Upon the highway of the sea
Ye billows of blue Hadriaâ€™s sea,
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
At last the author!â€ cries Mamma.
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
â€œSay, of the two which was Tattiana?â€
And silent as the maid Svetlana
And I, remembering Svetlana,
Next Saturday. The LÃ rina
Verses and tears et cetera.
BouyÃ noff whisked off Poustiakova.
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
Each other as the shore we climb!
Opened the portals of the tomb
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
He writes upon his parentsâ€™ tomb,
Or for the solitary tomb
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
The inmate is for ever dumb,
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
He oft upon his lips would curb,
Thinking: â€™tis foolish to disturb
He found them in an almanac,
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And triumphs in career erotic.
What! really going? â€™Tis too bad!
Above the ashes of the dead.
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
Some are afar and some are dead.
To seek him out with bended head.
Shaking with serious air the head,
Now of a family the head,
Wheneâ€™er he had an aching head;
And soon Lel hovered oâ€™er her head.
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
All silently hung down his head.
For patience, reader, I must plead!
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.â€
But on the third of grove and mead
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
But ah! discerns nor wood nor meadâ€”
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
And it may be a secret dread
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
I slumber much, a little read,
For on their brows I trembling read
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
Do not excuse yourself. I read
Some nice instructive novel read,
And lessons to his children read.
But presently she tried to read;
No other book had time to read.
A little farther please to read
Nor slander viciously could spread
And two old pines their branches spreadâ€”
The pile of books, with carpet spread
Thereon the passing traveller read:
But word for word his letter read.
That certain volumes she might read.
I Apuleius gladly read
For the impatient chief instead.
And cool sagacious mind he had:
Although we know that Eugene had
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Inhabited the country, clad
Attentive listened to the lad.
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
But Lenski, I should be so glad
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
He long should have been on the road.
Grant that I err not on the road.â€
He dragged her by a forest road
An idle anchorite and sad,
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
In love-lorn meditation sad.
I was incensed and he was sad.
(_Mechanically_, let us add),
Still certain authors, I may add,
At seven in summer rose from bed,
With book in hand reclined in bed,
Undressed herself and went to bed
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
With hopeless passion: from her bed
â€™Tis time for supper, now for bed,
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
And finally, upon his bed
She could not sleep in her new bed.
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Bear goneâ€”she at the threshold placed;
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Except one by the window placed
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
The friends are called and quickly placed.
He on his bosom gently placed
In coach or post-cart duly placed
And exclamations interlaced.
The two old ladies then embraced
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
In what he merely acquiesced.
To all good neighboursâ€™ sport conduced.
At LÃ rinaâ€™s abode produced
Most by this circumstance offended
All overtures of friendship ended.
The workpeople she superintended,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
It may be that I did proceedâ€”
Not all will like myself proceedâ€”
Thither in future to proceed
And cares not farther to proceed;
â€™Tis done. To supper they proceed.
Will not five centuries exceed
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
Mortally sick I am indeed.
His uncle, busy man indeed,
Remarkable. She then indeed
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
But I perceive thou dost not heedâ€”â€
He took no more the slightest heed;
â€œEnough, arise! for much we need
â€œEnough, arise! for much we need
Up to the attic, and all need
She seeks the garden in her needâ€”
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Had run across her path at speed,
Wheneâ€™er across the plain at speed
Nay, nearâ€”but destiny decreedâ€”
From the moist cork the bottle freed
And all with one accord agreed,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
On the dull stage find all things changed,
But the date subsequently changed
By visions who was neâ€™er deranged
The wedding-day had been arranged,
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
A careless looker-on estranged
A breathless silence then, prolongedâ€”
A breathless silence then, prolongedâ€”
What visions then her fancy throngedâ€”
What visions then her fancy throngedâ€”
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
And in society might shed
And in society might shed
I mourn, but tears I cannot shedâ€”
Just at that time his father died,
My mother-in-law who lately died
Vice in romance is glorified
Customs by ages sanctified,
A visionary mortified,
But now our minds are mystified
Was with himself dissatisfied.
But in his heart dissatisfied,
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
â€œAlack! Tattiana,â€ she replied,
Lenski unto the dame replied,
And a new diadem supplied.
The new moonâ€™s crescent slim she spied,
Tattianaâ€™s trouble might have spied,
By other thoughts be occupied.
By a rich pie were occupiedâ€”
Longtime her mind is occupied.
The princess from the sofa cried
â€œI shall expire,â€ Tattiana cried,
And not a speck of dirt descried.
The matter by his conscience tried,
To sketch myself that I have tried
I should alarm our friendship tried:
Successfully to please her tried,
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
And a long time about her talked.
He round the billiard-table stalked,
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
As if he cruelly had joked!
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
This life in masquerade concealed,
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
And such unconsciously he led,
A hermitâ€™s life OnÃ©guine led,
He conversation would have ledâ€”
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
Nor marked how summerâ€™s prime had fled
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
â€œWhat ails thee?â€â€”â€œNothing.â€â€”He is fled.
Repose her silken curtains fled,
The troop of apparitions fled,
The pains of night have wholly fled,
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
Of London life is â€œvulgarâ€ called
Is it that I am now compelled
Is it that I am now compelled
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
And with remorseful anguish filled,
As if with eider-down is filled.
Zaretski shouted: â€œWhy, heâ€™s killed!â€â€”
And heard a voice cryâ€”_Why! Heâ€™s killed!_â€”
The channel of the river stilled
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A life of fact, not fiction, ledâ€”
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
And to the field of honour led;
Surely ye all have overhauled
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
And in her conversation drawled.
But since to the backdoor they led
Transparent oâ€™er the Neva beamed
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
But kindness from his eye had beamed
And when the watery mirror gleamed
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
She never of deception dreamed
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?â€”
A few of different temper deemed,
OnÃ©guine wasâ€”so many deemed
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
Both natural and truthful seemed.
And endless the cotillon seemed
That our desires which noblest seemed,
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Feeling in others much esteemed.
A notoriety proclaimed,
A notoriety proclaimed,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
When hopeâ€™s delightful flower but bloomed
He thought so, and existence charmed.
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
How soon to habits she conformed
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Only her countenance assumed
The manly toga scarce assumed,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Where many another hand had signed
And vows will probably be signed:
Her money counted, and designed
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Made revelations undesigned,
Though, God be praised! he neâ€™er designed
Caricatures he now designed
That, for the century designed,
Or even, silent and resigned,
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
To arid selfishness resigned,
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Once more to idleness consigned,
Have eâ€™er a precious tress consigned,
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
A happy destiny ordained:
A valuable hostage gained,
A modern Regulus unchained,
Tattiana oâ€™er the stream complained;
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Rooted unto the spot remained.
Inseparable they remained.
O ye whom tender love hath pained
And saying this Vladimir drained
She consolation thence obtainedâ€”
A something somehow have obtained,
At fifty who relief obtained
My sum of happiness contained;
He sang of lifeâ€™s fresh colours stained
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
Before he eighteen years attained.
With us is easily attained.
The fruits of learning and combined
And handsome countenance combined,
A tender couplet he combined,
With intellect, a taste refined,
His chambers close wherein confined
Love to idealize inclined;
At first for books was disinclined,
Iâ€™m not for witchcraft now inclined.
And on the last one, underlined:
Anticipating woe she pined,
The venerable dame opined
Certain misfortune near opined.
Now a long branch itself entwined
Constant affection intertwined
Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
There, aping Gulnareâ€™s bard, he spanned
Though Baratynski verses penned,
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
The maidenâ€™s weary eye which yearned,
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
Tattiana more than ever burned
His neighbourâ€™s lowly tomb and mourned
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
To his Penates now returned,
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
He on the conflagration frowned.
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
Into the cups already sped
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of his approach; but nothing cared
A countenance perplexed and scared.
An explanation: she was scared,
Her features no grimaces bleared;
Another with cockâ€™s head appeared,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
A faithful model she appeared
To an assemblyâ€”she appeared
But this a heinous crime appeared
But in the drawing-room all appeared
And Taniaâ€™s husband soon appeared.â€”
For evermore had disappeared.
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared.â€
My image hath not disappeared,
My image hath not disappeared,
With Olga; nor of this appeared
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Asunder was and hate prepared?
He went notâ€”sooner was prepared
I mused: perhaps the matterâ€™s squaredâ€”
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Upon the Donâ€™s broad pastures bred
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
And many another slily sneered;
In her affairs neâ€™er interfered,
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
Their glory with their heels of red
His soul by crash of music fired,
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
By indolence and languor fired
Singing God knows what maid admired,
To kiss the feet which I admired!
In amorous flights when so inspired,
His tea with rum no more desired,
How like the billow I desired
The fated nutriment desired;
And both of dull existence tired,
I long by ballets have been bored,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Though beauty he no more adored,
His ruffian bravery adored,
Either she saw not or ignored;
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
And harmony was soon restored.
Contented and with victuals stored,
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
I long enough deceived have erred.
Of the romances she preferred,
And what she from the cards inferred.
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
Tattiana every day conferred
Thus widely meditation erred,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Of Olga he in song averred;
As Saadi anciently averredâ€”
In the recesses what hath stirred
Whilst from her countenance neâ€™er stirred
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
OnÃ©guineâ€™s speeches I abhorred
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
He who economy abhorred,
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
Of censure for the same incurred;
The poet from Tamboff secured,
Till proper rings could be procured.
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!â€
At first, but soon became inured
On melted wax in water poured;
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
In fact, some people were assured
Rebuffedâ€”as quickly reassured,
A marriageable maid matured,
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!â€
The shining pistols are uncased,
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
More timid than a doe long chased,
The contact of the foot I raised
And leaning â€™gainst the portal closed
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
To her an elegy composed.
And FliÃ noff, somewhat indisposed,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
In love adventures she was versed,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Alas! for now before her passed
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
At home arriving he addressed
At times three words to him addressed
Replaced them in their box, undressed
The style in which my hero dressed;
When all around the entrance pressed,
â€œWhat ails thee, dear?â€â€”â€œI feel depressed.
But sits in bed with air depressed,
Are not with elegance impressed.
The image of her seal impressed.
And kindness Tania was impressed,
OnÃ©guine was the most impressed,
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
How much is in that word expressed!
So she in French herself expressed.
Not agony, but death expressed.
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
But once more pensive and distressed
Then weeping she sank back distressed
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
But tremor still her frame possessed,
The maid whose note he still possessed
If the poor maiden could have guessed
Within that secret court discussed,
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
By friendship how they were abused,
No signs of trouble her accused,
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
BouyÃ noff courted. She refused.
Nought in the universe refused:
And though her soul might be confused,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
Some Russian authors he perusedâ€”
A book at early morn perused.
Not that she had his works perused,
The room my former master used.
In fact, the subject analysed,
Even so! His passions soon abated,
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
He ought to have conciliated
By daily life deteriorated,
He might his motives have narrated,
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Nor long his mind was agitated
Awhile this beauty captivated,
Were to analysis subjected.
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
And life and fate in turn selected
They long at home have her expectedâ€”
His visit she had not awaited,
Tattiana with impatience waited
A bastard fame prohibited?
A bastard fame prohibited?
Vladimir Lenski visited
How the young imp on Tania doted!
To captivate her how devoted!
By Olgaâ€™s hand distributed
And every year distributed
All mothers their sweet girls believed
Of what he thought and what believed,
And she at last hath us deceived;
Lenski as a good match received,â€”
In vain was youth by us received,
Upon those margins she perceived
Retained the image, though short-lived,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
At an old auntâ€™s they had arrived
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
A new proprietor arrived,
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
Which afterwards the muse revived.
The conversation was revived
Who had for four long years survived
Turned and replied as it behoved,
When but a boy he Olga loved
Perceived that he was still beloved,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Already by repentance moved
OnÃ©guine, by first impulse moved,
And as a country damsel roved,
And these the attentive maid observed
Strictly the Carnival observed,
And ancient usages observed
For first â€œmadameâ€ his wants observed,
(For which our praise he hath deserved).
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
And numerous pages had preserved
They in a peaceful life preserved
A mien unaltered she preserved,
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But proudly in his song preserved
The gifted songster never swerved,
And when her violence reviewedâ€”
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
In company, or simply bowed,
Et cetera_; but nothing showed
He gazed upon the clock which showed
A scant attendance Lenski showed
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
OnÃ©guine neâ€™er as poet showed
But from the interview what flowed?
The insensate fire of love still glowed
And privileges nice allowed,
Enraptured was he if allowed
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
In correspondence been allowed.
Passionâ€™s wild sway I then allowed,
And necessary fools allowed.
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Titles and ages intermixed.
He with his little maiden played,
At prisonerâ€™s base she never played.
The deuce with my inside has played.â€
The drama of my youth was played.
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
In Olgaâ€™s face no lifeâ€™s displayed.
Eight rubbers were already played,
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
Attend in male attire arrayed.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
That we her constantly betrayed
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Change of position had essayed,
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
Their giddy sports she neâ€™er enjoyed.
Yet was her inmost soul oâ€™erjoyed
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?â€”
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
And is all light within destroyed?
â€œWhat is your name?â€ The boor looked dazed,
She on the apparition gazed,
Again imagination blazed,
And â€œAgathonâ€ replied, amazed.
And vehemently though amazed
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
With tenderness hath recognized
For which the poet agonized
In much his conduct stigmatized;
And long perukes hath vanishÃ¨d.
And her upon the threshold laid.
He found him on the table laid,
And many a day thereafter laid
The powder in the pan is laid,
Should go, the market for a maid,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
A load of care upon the maid.
Beneath her parentsâ€™ eyes the maid
At early morn returns the maid
Singing inside her hut the maid
She comprehends. The simple maid
She comprehends. The simple maid
My pretty self-deceiving maidâ€”
Remained with him the youthful maid.
In Olgaâ€™s album, youthful maid,
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
For shame lift up the modest maid.
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
A due which must to earth be paid.
To classicism Iâ€™ve homage paid,
Fortune the poet had repaid.
Nor frigid adulation paid.
That bilberry wine, Iâ€™m sore afraid,
No time to pick it up! afraid,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
OnÃ©guine then approached and said:
Gazing into his face, she said:
â€œPoor Yorick,â€ mournfully he said,
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
What they in conversation said?â€”
Adieu she to the matron said
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
Though scarcely following what was said,
With many a vacancy, â€™tis said.â€â€”
In whispers low the neighbours said:
But finally she softly said:
But finally she softly said:
Vladimir something curtly said
And spectacles, his knitting staid
So be it! Just the laws which bid
Better than Chateaubriand did
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
In mist profound all yet is hid.
Had rendered him an invalid;
Returning, from his ship amid
Wherefore am I your quarry held?â€”
Wherefore am I your quarry held?â€”
She dreamt she journeyed oâ€™er a field
As one who bivouacs afield,
Scornfully challenged you afieldâ€”
And thus in season the rich field
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
What are they? Gladly would I yield
And can it be? But late a child
â€œWhat can be done? She is no child!â€
An ardent heart and yet so mild?â€”
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
With an imagination wild,
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
The wolf upon the highways bold
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
But cannot stand the northern cold.
His mother from the door doth scold.
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
The morn arises foggy, cold,
And Limburg cheese alive and old
He took the room wherein the old
How empires store of wealth unfold,
But that Princess Pauline of old,
I also wandered there of old,
â€œWe never loved in days of old,
These evenings as in days of old
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
The medium is required of gold.
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Some marriageable maids behold,
In one he doth accounts behold,
And the suspicious veteran old,
Tattiana in traditions old
An almanac but eight years old.
In dreams and what the moon foretold
Had killed me had the like been told.â€
Her Moscow cousin, often told
And the young ladies fortunes told,
Heard he the truth? And thus she couldâ€”
She promised Eugene, or she would
To Olga frequently he would
Of friends unceremonious would
The Nevaâ€™s Cleopatra, and
Existâ€”that their immortal band
No one appeared to lend a hand.
Than health, so with a trembling hand
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
With the â€œWell-Wisherâ€ in her hand!
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Her foot was in my other hand.
Some wretched journal in his hand;
A loaded pistol in his hand.
A weary season was at handâ€”
Of Africa, ancestral land,
The ruts of his own fatherland.
With thoughts of a far distant land,
When, where, and in what desert land,
Friends of the sons of every land,
And in the bathroom did command
In times gone by thy bare commandâ€”â€
Sickness more courage doth command
Of a strange night when the moon andâ€”
The poet, modest though so grand,
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
To dream upon the sunny strand
With blessings on the ditches and
Gazing on Lenskiâ€™s corse did standâ€”
November at the gate did stand.
None the conviction could withstand
Immersed in secret thought I stand
â€œOh! nurse, nurse, you donâ€™t understand!
At each extreme one takes his stand,
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her tears flow plentifully and
To thy decree my will I bend.
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
To Love all ages lowly bend,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
Wearied of leisure in the end,
And had with waddling in the end
Charms more enduring in the end.
And thou, persistent to the end,
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
Are admirable, my dear friend,
In duel having killed his friend
Will you?â€â€”â€œAgreed.â€â€”â€œI thank you, friend,â€
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
If not, the money I will lend.â€
An ear to my confession lend;
Their natural attractions lend
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
And they the waters recommend.
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
All to the doctors Eugene send,
â€œEnough to see one winterâ€™s end;
Assistance ever will extend,
Farther Tattianaâ€™s walks extendâ€”
Into the starry night extend.
Quick to the country let us wend
But finally in wedlock bind.
His mournful heart no peace could find,
The young proprietor we find;
Upon the opening page ye find:
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
But what astonished do I find
Fresh cause of quarrel then Iâ€™ll find,
Infallibly you there will find
But trembles, words he cannot find,
The wood she entersâ€”bear behind,â€”
Of dreary Russia left behind,
â€œYour second you have left behind!â€
Perchance to benefit mankind,
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A duellist of classic mind,
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Had perished a creative mind,
His immorality of mind
From mere vacuity of mind
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
Become alarmed. So never mind!
One image occupied his mind,
But one thought only filled his mind,
It gradually possessed his mind;
Of all the guests within his mind.
OnÃ©guineâ€™s pencillings. His mind
A pair; though desolate my mind,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
And the recesses of my mind
So uncongenial to my mind,
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Of whirligigs were very fond,
And stoves of various shapes abound.
Funeral amateurs abound!
However cherries might abound,
What jokes and guesses now abound,
Until her heart less high should boundâ€”
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
These to the coach of state are bound,
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
The lancer, to his calling bound,
A stream, by winterâ€™s ice unbound,
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
She wore her corset tightly bound,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
And if Tattiana mine had foundâ€”
Lo! in my garden was she found
This monument of thought profound
From hence engrossed in thought profound
(This by command; for it was found,
Examined, mended, newly found
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Endless conjectures all propound
And secretly their views expound.
But suddenly all changed around!
Imperial portraits hang around
And from the country all around
And devastate the woods around.
Selfish nonentities around?
The German baker looks around
The snows from off the hills around
A tangled wilderness around.
But, when OnÃ©guineâ€™s turn came round,
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And flooded all the level ground.
Of horn in circle call them round.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Recovering, Tania gazes round;
Soon Olgaâ€™s accents shrill resound
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
Congratulations, toasts resound,
And by the fiddleâ€™s rushing sound
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
The Russian N with nasal sound
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
If he had only known the wound
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
Debate commanded ample foodâ€”
As to a worthy man and good!
The fruits of science, evil, good,
Such is the country custom good;
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
And spur my spiritâ€™s torpid mood!
Absorbed in melancholy mood
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
OnÃ©guine meditative stood,
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
Lessons to give he understood!
Whose author nature understood
At this time almost understood.
A village and beneath, a wood,
Dark was the valley and the wood
The river through the linden wood.
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
â€œWhither away? Deuce take the bard!â€â€”
Triquet arose, and for the bard
He was no more! The youthful bard
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
In loveâ€™s campaigns OnÃ©guine heard
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
Her utterances ever heard,
What never was remarked or heard
When in the grand saloon was heard
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
Tattiana would have gladly heard
And ought he not to disregard
A noted fop who gambled hard.
Your conversation cold and hard,
Your conversation cold and hard,
The poetâ€™s madness? for â€™tis hard
â€œI wonâ€™t detain you; but â€™tis hard
A young and handsome galliard.
What doth she see? Around the board
The company deep silence guard.
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
He hies unto the â€œBoulevard,â€
She enters a deserted yardâ€”
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
Believed, the peopleâ€™s wisdom weird,
Marmontel also, tome the third;
Epistle second, note the third,
Whose qualities appeared to afford
She deemed its outline might afford.
Lo! my OnÃ©guine rural lord!
Sighs on another than her lord
To dominate her worthy lord,
Command him not to say a wordâ€”
Reform me both in deed and word,
Together they returned, nor word
Each gust of temper, silly word,
OnÃ©guine wasted; on my word,
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Of late I have been quite absurd,â€”
No more the music thunders loud,
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
And never hath our language proud
Of my light paramour was proud.
Even as Moscow, city proud.
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
Or recognized not in the crowd.
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
That girlâ€”but he must dreaming beâ€”
But what a nuisance it will be,
Will to the old times faithful be.
Callous to all he seemed to be.
Feelings which long had ceased to be
I would desire my bride to beâ€”
Is still condemned in love to be;
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
And this fifth canto ought to be
As lordly mansions ought to be,
He mused: â€œI will her saviour be!
As many entertainments be!
â€œDo notâ€”you mightâ€”suspicious be;
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
Or a swift meteor, may be,
(One and the same thing it may be)
Or reconciled them, it may be,
With worldly honours, it may be,
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Inseparable soon they be.
Whilst he â€œbelle Ninaâ€ had the face
Time will the ravages effaceâ€”
And physic bring with mournful face,
Where the first time I saw your face,â€”
But gazes on OnÃ©guineâ€™s face
But gazes on OnÃ©guineâ€™s face
No more the village knows his face,
Pallid and melancholy face,
â€œShe who with melancholy face
OnÃ©guineâ€”the beloved place
Bright blazed the window of the place,
By â€œbelle Tattianaâ€ to replace.
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
And then â€œmonsieurâ€ supplied her place;
Hard by the window took her place.â€â€”
The damsel under escort place.
Drank to her health in the first place,
And after them at headlong pace
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
â€œWarm yourself here a little space!â€
At the front gates, but in brief space
Accelerates her hasty pace,
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
The boy was wild but full of grace.
An ancient lady full of grace.â€”
Then handed her the song with grace.
The easier â€™tis to gain her grace,
He called to mind Tattianaâ€™s grace,
A print without the pictureâ€™s grace,
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
And who the rent-roll of his race
Inheritor of all his race.
For there he left a mournful trace.
And my Eugene the path must traceâ€”
Neâ€™er trusted to the treacherous ace.
Of the commencement of the piece.
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
Behold! than polished floor more nice
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
The shining river clothed in ice;
Like his, her dress was always nice,
But wherefore not?â€”â€™Tis pleasant, nice,
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
Euphonious, though I know a spice
In mother Winterâ€™s strange caprice.
And the extent of his caprice;
And shall adopt some new caprice.
Upon the table in a trice
The excited hero in a trice
But contrary to her advice
Then theyâ€™re so innocent of vice,
Two poles together glued by ice,
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
And his strange conduct at the dance
Again in her ethereal dance?
Before him her wild game of chance.
Well, if your pistol ball by chance
In serious mood or dalliance
His momentary loving glance
God grant that all who herein glance,
A pensive sorrow in her glance
Who by a haughty word or glance
In groups, official striplings glance
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Or will my melancholy glance
Upon the stage his weary glance.
The days of love and of romance!
And in her hand a French romance.
Canto the First of this romance.
Reviews both dress and countenance,
When people with long countenance
Seek the forgotten countenance
He yawns, averts his countenance,
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
Then would we muse as in a trance,
The heroâ€™s name too in advance,
And views amongst themselves advance
Such open-hearted innocence.
Of her provincial innocence
Then to reward such confidence
Tattiana learns the intelligenceâ€”
Her amorous experience
He wanders in his indolence;
And natural benevolence,
And aimless journeys did commenceâ€”
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
Oh! what had been his eminence!
Habit would bring indifference.
I yield with a low reverence;
To friendship making no pretence,
I cannot tell on what pretenceâ€”
His energy and impotence.
But this adventureâ€™s consequence
I, after so much eloquence,
Not to behave as he did onceâ€”
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Our idol, Honourâ€™s motive force,
And the newcomers welcome bade.
And yet oblivion forbade.
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
It may be that his martyred shade
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
As in a thicketâ€™s humble shade,
Hid in the gondolaâ€™s dark shade,
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Beneath the sheltering oak treeâ€™s shade
There, there, beneath the side-sceneâ€™s shade
In the Lyceumâ€™s noiseless shade
Was the first question Olga made,
He whom we sing to shall be made
I was for calm existence made,
Straight for the entrance then he made
Though the foul vision promise made
Though late, have a beginning made.
But sad is the reflection made,
But no reply unto her made.
For our amusement ever made
Nor further comment that night made.
Whose heart experience icy made
A certain little escapade
They shovel silver with a spade,
The goddess would a masquerade
Choosing a profitable trade,
Were I like you a bard by tradeâ€”
But cannot anyhow evade
And what will Destiny concede?â€
For ever faithful will abide.â€
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
His fate shall presently decide.
But I am now anotherâ€™s brideâ€”
Like Leonora did she ride
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
She leisurely away doth ride,
â€œHe promised here this day to ride,â€
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
Amid the soulless sons of pride
A bearded postillion astride
Unto the windmill he must ride
On horseback every day they rideâ€”
Mute glances interchanged aside
In consultation stand asideâ€”
But now all doubt was set aside,
Suddenly to the left hand side,
And soon OnÃ©guineâ€™s door beside
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
And glittering simpletons beside;
A pair of bulletsâ€”nought besideâ€”
And hastened to his uncleâ€™s side,
Yes, happyâ€”though she at his side
Tattiana by a poor auntâ€™s side,
But grown familiar side by side
Found them in darkness side by side,
If thou wert sitting by my side,
Jaws are at work. On every side
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
Always together, eventide
Meet punishment for him provide.
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
And death before the husband wide
And the saloon threw open wide;
OnÃ©guine oped the cupboards wide.
Noblesse and models of the mode,
Of a most mournful episode,
To foreign lands he would allude,
And unto whom we all allude
Deep in the distant province rude,
Upon my visions such intrude.
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Secure in rural quietudeâ€”
Then, thenâ€”well, in some solitude
Before whom once in solitude,
Where long time he in solitude
In worldly din or solitude
Since Eugene in that solitude
Fly frequent to my solitude,
My soul is filled with gratitude!
My soul is filled with gratitude!
Measured with great exactitude.
Displayed a noble rectitudeâ€”
Displayed a noble rectitudeâ€”
My scholar without aptitude
To part in amity with thee!
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
Then, I say truly, none but thee
â€œShall I proceed, or homeward flee?
â€™Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
By Providenceâ€™s dark decree!
This lot in life with stern decree?
Tender and elevated, free?
When shall I wing my passage free
From such digressions wholly free.
Impressed him in the least degree,â€”
Perchance he will to all the three.
Yet sometimes pages two or three
His valet brings him letters three.
Tome of â€œMalvina,â€ and but three
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
The poetâ€™s hour hath soundedâ€”See!
The house and garden I would see.â€
And a guitar produced we see,
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Gallop, mazurka, waltzingâ€”see!
Virgins miraculous I see,
The giddy world at last shall see.
Whither shall he go first? Heâ€™ll see,
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
He usually was glad to see
â€œOlinka is her junior, see.
The break of day she doth not see,
The letter is the thing, you see,â€”
A mansionâ€”by the window, see!
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
Such was OnÃ©guineâ€™s sainted life,
To move in fashionable life,
To move in fashionable life,
He in the early years of life
Who floats contentedly through life,
Commence a new career in life
Whilst the fond parents, friends throâ€™ life,
And like his shadow dogged his life,
In many things had changed his lifeâ€”
He knew not how to spend his life.
Should be respected throughout life
And leads a solitary life?
And rest from bygone days of strife.
In aimless ease and far from strife,
Of error and the passionsâ€™ strife.
The Muse abandoned, taâ€™en a wife,
By every proper-minded wife,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
Wherein the miserable wife
Or better,â€”like a faithful wife.
By children and by faithful wife
That I am rich, a princeâ€™s wife?â€”
That I am rich, a princeâ€™s wife?â€”
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
Without profession, business, wife,
You choose.â€â€”â€œBut who is she?â€â€”â€œMy wife.â€
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
But at a later, sterile age,
In boston and the game of age,
And testy gamesters do engage
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
Or in a squabble to engage,
Sterner solicitudes engage,
Another could her heart engage,
A visionary personage
As once, to fill the rapid page
Saint Priest, who every albumâ€™s page
Or faults of grammar on its pageâ€”
With humble prose Iâ€™ll fill my page
As storms which in chill autumn rage
Thus having braved Apolloâ€™s rage
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
As the reflection of his age,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
Another could her woe assuage
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Each gave Tattianaâ€™s arm a nudge
For two whole days it seemed a change
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
But sweeter still it is to arrange
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
Placed at the customary range;
No one the contrary will urge,
Again a century should scourge
Unto his own Tattiana he,
The traveller, bird of passage he,
That girl whom once on a time he
For empty sound the rascal swore he
A paragon of virtue he!
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
All are amazed; but Lenski he
Three mortal hours per diem he
Tania well nigh expired when he
And by a sweet delusion he
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
Voices and hands applaud, and she
And in her native language she
And a half rubles down gave she;
Nor on the letter yet hath she
â€œOh! I remember, where is he?â€â€”
She oped her eyes and cried: â€™tis he!
And disappear in space; then she
She sits aloneâ€”â€™tis ever _she!_
On such a day. O Heavens, â€™tis she!
And an encouragement did breathe
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
They first of all my brow did wreathe
No fond illusions live to soothe,
A dying man with art to soothe,
Men love no more, as only the
On Sundays by yon window he,
Dressed like a London dandy he
The family of children hie.
Upon the earth a mist did lie
When deaf and silent he doth lie
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
Thereâ€™ll be a fight. I do not lie.
_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.
Contemplate her sad reverie.
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Dark, unavailing reverie,
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
The bridge and alley to the lake,
Her promptings unto law did make,
I the same admonition make.
He deemed his friends but longed to make
Acquaintance instantly to make.
Eâ€™en as the presence of a snake,
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Great sacrifices for his sake!
For law I _far niente_ take
My sportive Muse I used to take
And every morning I awake
Or any trifle else ye like
Pedantic although scholar like,
Of the horizon she is like!â€â€”
â€œThe post hath kept him, it is like.â€
By computation) it is like
OnÃ©guine waits on us, â€™tis like.â€
The comrade of your youth should strike,
â€œâ€™Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
Then suddenly discharge a joke
A bogy conjured up in joke,
And barely visible the smoke
How artless was the note which spoke
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
And Lenski followedâ€”a light brokeâ€”
The ladiesâ€™ laughter to provoke.
Tattiana terrified awoke.
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
Already sings the nightingale.
Nor the frost particles inhale
But now in her effulgence pale
She, than the morning moon more pale,
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
OnÃ©guineâ€™s cheek grew ashy pale,
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Thus we began our little taleâ€”
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,
I tried when I began this tale,
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
I know thereâ€™s none more amiable.
Fashion is there immutable,
Honour and pride inflexible.
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Regained authority awhile,
Singing in chorus all the while.
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
To see aughtâ€”never mind meanwhile)
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
Espying, Eugene with a smile
As rosy lips without a smile,
They crack a feeble joke and smileâ€”
That afterwards with evil smile
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Cannot they amicably smile
â€™Twas built, the venerable pile,
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
But he desired not to beguile
Shall my declining years beguile;
The Russian language I deem vile
Also the works of Fontenelle,
About the rain and flax and cattle.â€â€”
In their sterility of prattle,
Preserves and an eternal prattle
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
I owe the censorship a little.
But will not modify a tittleâ€”
The crystals of her vestibule
Though correspondence as a rule
Careless of every social rule,
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
He wrote (â€™tis the romantic style,
Her toiletteâ€™s antiquated style,
Avenge himself in proper style.
A novel in Lafontaineâ€™s style,
To sketch ye in Albanoâ€™s style.
In solid, unpretentious style,
And a romance in ancient style
The door flew openâ€”Olga came,
Hateful the hollow world became,
Tattiana faltered, and became
Nor by her beauty she became
Because a member I became.
From Gottingen inspired he came,
And straight returning whence he came,
â€œAnd is it long since back he came?
Will he pursue?â€”But no one came.
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
But when the winter season came
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Athwart the snow four paces cameâ€”
Her shoulderâ€”Olga swiftly cameâ€”
But turn we once more to our dame.
Wheneâ€™er a brilliant courtly dame
And comfort of each country dame,
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
In hopes of everlasting fame
And at the altar of their fame
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
Strange unto her each childish game,
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
Trembles at artificial shame.
By recklessness amuse or shame
That vicious set whom I donâ€™t blameâ€”
He kindled his poetic flame.
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
By loveâ€™s inevitable flame.
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
Is it that ardent souls of flame
Who knows? with loveâ€™s consuming flame
More blooming than the Boreal flame
But fashionable hatredâ€™s flame
And in addition youth is flame
We are the first who such a name
And so Tattiana was her name,
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
A finished madrigal would frame
She waits, on fire her trembling frameâ€”
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Pray is it he? It is the same.
Another passed; â€™twas just the same.
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
The old Derjavine noticed me,
His character attracted me.
And fled afarâ€”she followed me.
Of many an economic scheme;
And my romanceâ€™s open theme
The olden time shall be my theme.
And then the stanzas of my theme
Who reads his visionary theme
Of touching lightly every theme.
He with an innocence extreme
Descends the bank with care extreme,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
ï»¿â€œMy uncleâ€™s goodness is extreme,
And, inspiration firing me,
Until the sleepless BrÃ©guet chime
Transported to our Russian clime.
And visit many a foreign clime,
On sunny days the glistening rime,
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
His footing on the treacherous rime
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
She is an angel! We sometime
For a protracted space of time.
And thus he spent eight years of time,
Her figure perfect grows with time!
Announcing to him dinner-time.
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
It now to investigate is time,
How in the country pass this time?
And may fall headlong any time.
Despair and anger seize on me,
Across her youth a shade had come,
Tiresome unto her hath become
All dark and silent hath become;
Callous to all on earth becomeâ€”
And shorter had the days become.
Straight from their province had he come?â€â€”
I am in love, my hour hath come!
Though to the Academy I come
When will my hour of freedom come!
In winter time would often come.
Nor shall the caterpillar come
At eventide would hither come,
He wakesâ€”they with a letter comeâ€”
Triumphant with the answer come.
To take a hand at whist oft come:
His name: the tenderness of home
Yes! for our unpretending home,
As in her heart the thought sank home,
Long, long the hour had past when home
No longer through her former home;
Time was, two maidens from their home
The Princess N. will be at home
Homeward returning, he at home
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
The bard his answer waits at home,
With better half as cumbersome;
That first the Muse appeared to me.
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
â€œAh! come, Tattiana, come to me!
Mournful is thine approach to me,
But Iâ€”what is all this to me?
What is thy cleverness to me?
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
â€œAh! nurse, a favour do for me!â€â€”
Howl like a dolt: â€™tis meant for me!
Open the windowâ€”sit by me.â€
In the lone garden and the lane?
In the lone garden and the lane?
Oft staring through the window pane
A shape half cat and half a crane.
Undeviating and insane
Of the domains of the side-scene.
Struck Lenski deadâ€”across the scene
But shall depict the touching scene
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
The village wherein yawned Eugene
The strife grew furious and Eugene
Such were the musings of Eugene.
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
â€œMy second!â€ cried in turn Eugene,
All this was novel to Eugene.
He was in error; for Eugene
â€œAnd is it,â€ meditates Eugene.
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
She roseâ€”departed. But Eugene
And so departed. But Eugene,
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
Between myself and my Eugene,
As a poetic life serene,
And irrigate them with champagne;
Are turned upon her. All combine
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
â€œDeparted Lenski here to dine
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
Behold the dames who once were fine
A single being: â€™twas in fine
The sneers of critics superfine;
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,â€”
And make a dark existence shine
The lamps illuminating shine;
He could in disputation shine
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?â€â€”
â€œPrincesse, mon ange!â€â€”â€œPachette!â€â€”â€œAline!â€
Diminishes as years decline.
Do all things which to mirth incline.
The kennel or a kindred line,
Akulka who was once Celine,
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
Corset and album and Pauline,
With many a snare their pathway line!
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
No other than OnÃ©guine mine.
Well known unto OnÃ©guine mine.
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
BouyÃ noff, wrathful cousin mine,
In your young days and also mine),
In one great shout: sheâ€™s mine! sheâ€™s mine!
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Of my impassioned heroine.
Dreaming herself the heroine
Never upon my heroine
A tombstone, Aphroditeâ€™s shrine,
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
Is it for long?â€â€”â€œMa chÃ¨re cousine!â€
Lest the world or her lord divine
Before the dregs they shall divine
Another bard with art divine
Long tortured by his lay divine,
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
About the crop of hay, the wine,
Give me just half a glass of wineâ€”
Of the cup brimming oâ€™er with wineâ€”
With loud explosion, the bright wine
Our dear old aunt, Princess HelÃ¨ne,
All to the grand saloon are goneâ€”
To pass the night at home hath gone.
Can she have been a moment gone
The ball in all its splendour shone.
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
That hero, though his merit shone,
â€œNurse, leave me. I would be alone.
Having for moneyâ€™s sake alone
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
Certainly not Eugene alone
When, sitting by his fire alone
â€™Twas these he read and these alone
To sigh and meditate alone:
In horror for itself alone,
Upon her brow sits wrath aloneâ€”
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
The riverâ€™s bank. Tattiana lone
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Good-night.â€ Behold! she is alone!
Waiting his comingâ€”his alone!
Moina recalls for this alone
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
And in the frosty night alone
That mediocrity alone
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Though around honoured Priamâ€™s throne
â€œMine!â€ cried Eugene with savage tone.
Said something in an undertone
She murmurs in an undertone
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
That all may hear his voiceâ€™s tone.
That like a friendly voice its tone
But that the eyes of every one
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
No answer all that day was borne.
A constant harping on one tune,
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
Of fashionable dames the foe,
The mystic monogram, O. E.
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
The aged woman in her woe:
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
Or quietly partake our woe.
Eâ€™en hopeless egoismâ€™s dark shape.
â€œAh! long the world hath missed thy shape!
With taffety instead of crape.
Could in romantic mantle drape
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
â€™Tis dreadfulâ€”ye agree, I hopeâ€”
Had bid her sigh for without hopeâ€”
For a fictitious misanthrope,
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
On horseback gallop oâ€™er the steppe!
His inner consciousness laid bare,
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
Was he in health and void of care?â€”
I am acquainted with fresh care,
Tattianaâ€™s beauty, pale with care,
Albums magnificent which scare
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
Lenski at intervals would dare,
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
The vile seducer shall not dare
Though I confess I hardly dare
O Men, how very like ye are
Or vainly â€™mid luxurious fare
With Ozeroff was wont to share
And impiously should declare,
I cannot help it I declare,
None could her beautiful declare,
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
The riot of the world and glare
The crash of music, candlesâ€™ glare
And the more surely we ensnare
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
But, O ye tomes without compare,
Here I remark all poets are
I ask, all ye who poets are,
Moscowâ€™s young Graces at her stare,
Tattianaâ€™s love was quite sincere,
Now I am fit for nothing here.
Which in the elevated sphere
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.
â€œAbandon hope for ever here!â€
She sank.â€”â€œHeâ€™s here! Eugene is here!
(I speak not of our poems here),
And Eugene soon discovered there
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
With all their progeny were there,
Alone the princess sitteth there,
I promised!â€”Did I so?â€”Well, there!
Tattiana gently led them there.
The young Simeonova too there
It may be ye were born, or there
And yet the cityâ€™s flower was there,
â€œThe left? Why, what on earth is there?â€â€”
And lo! he is already there!
Was born beside the Neva, where
He bends his course to Talonâ€™s, where
Faces which we meet everywhere
And be not in advance severe.
I yield the fruit of work severe.
Just as he entered. How severe!
If the choice in my power were,
If the choice in my power were,
And dark and drear the evenings were,
As if impossible it were
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
Olga with trepidation dire.
Would haste in agitation dire
Oblivion of lifeâ€™s tempest dire,
And spouted it with lyric fireâ€”
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Authors replete with sacred fire
Or bosom full of languid fire,â€”
The proud ones are not worth the fire
For our Automedons are fire
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
Their privileged allurements fire
With our OnÃ©guine doth aspire
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Yet still apparently aspire
And that no longer could inspire.
He deemed his coming would inspire
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
Whose tones Apolloâ€™s sons inspire,
Raged round him and of balked desire!
To mutter her concealed desire
A hidden train of wild desire.
All that perfection could desire;
All that a poet could desire,
He felt the laudable desire
This world. I do not praise desire,
So ardently did I desire
Which glowed with virginal desire.
But Lenski, having no desire
Adieu! whateâ€™er thou didst desire
At a great feast against desire,
Slowly exhausted by desire,
His constant soul could ever tire,
And our swift troikas never tire;
The wit of others to acquire.
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
And brooding oâ€™er the ills he bore,
Opened with care, and entering bore
Within my memory I bore
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Or, as it were, the Freischutzâ€™ score
The Russian winter did adore
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
Whom thirty centuries adore.
And the young girl appeared before
He was deceived. Just as before
He read as vainly as before,
My spirit with such pangs before.
Thouâ€™lt suffer, dearest, but before,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
How oft to the Crimean shore
To help her to the other shore
Of the imperial Nevaâ€™s shore.
The captives of the Salguirâ€™s shore.
Or by the oceanâ€™s rocky shore.
â€™Tis time to quit this weary shore
Society renounced once more.
With it may be a couple more;
With affectation,â€”nothing more.
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
As if against obstruction sore
A gust of passion never tore
Away her golden earrings tore;
Endowing us from out her store
As bees who leave their dainty store
And homeward like an arrow tore.
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
BouyÃ noff too, my cousin, wore
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
â€œWho would have thought it? As of yore!
â€œBut which, my dear?â€”In days of yore
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
For who imposture can endure,
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
But competition I abjure
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
Then my companions young with pleasure
In history he took no pleasure,
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
For longâ€”for ever. To be sure
â€œSit down. How funny, to be sure!
And then she soon â€™twixt work and leisure
In the unfettered hours of leisure
He will delight you, I am sure,
That my dishonour would ensure
That my dishonour would ensure
Serious endeavours to assure
Happy who timely grew mature,
And after Albionâ€™s proud lyre
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
Ye need dissimulation base
Felled a calumniator base!
For my wild garden and bookcase,â€”
That a friendâ€™s arm in every case
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
â€œCan I inspect the mansion, please?â€
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
Possession hath no power to please,
Napoleon tarried till it please
O epic Muse, my powers increase
To cool the cutletsâ€™ seething grease,
Of modern Russians the disease.
A very troublesome disease,
If seriously he hath disease;
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
But Taniaâ€™s heart is not at ease,
In motley and amusing chase.
The curs away to kennel chase,
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
Not even a poetic phrase,
I say without poetic phrase,
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
Handbook of fashionable phrase
To russify the foreign phrase
Who every gesture, every phrase
Eugene would speak regarding these.
It matters not. Hope eâ€™en to these
From careless stanzas such as these,
She would pronounce _Ã  la FranÃ§aise_;
She mourned and to the moon would raise
And in her languid bosom raise
Of passion they so often raise.
To God eternal hymns of praise.
As cyphers others to appraise,
Away! and cease to ring their praise
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
And where the billows hoarsely raise
The curtain now they slowly raise.
Because he could not gourmandise
They growl a bitâ€”they scandaliseâ€”
Crushing and a confusing noise;
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
Tired by the ballâ€™s incessant noise,
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Miraculously fair arise,
Where melancholy rocks arise
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Of the night sentinels arise
And would by candlelight arise.
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
The LÃ rinas were since sunrise
Late in the afternoon to rise,
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
He has returned, say in what guise?
Olga the tea must superviseâ€”
He is a charming youth and wise.
Olga began to long likewise
â€œIs he the same or grown more wise?
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
Manâ€”forty years long in this wiseâ€”
But now a question in this wise
With his exasperated sense,
May be the empire of the sense,
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
Pervaded with much common sense.
And I admired their common sense
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Though now my love might be intense,
Inspired but weariness intense;
We hear with interest intense
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Ladies in crowds around her close,
A curious interest disclose
Malignant fury they disclose,
The windows whitened, shutters closeâ€”
â€œCommand me, darling, what you chooseâ€â€”
But nowhere can she find repose,
Do agitate his late repose.
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
When, wise at length, we seek repose
And where at last his bones repose
But better loved the soft repose
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
He enters. High the cork arose
And the conviction soon arose,
Furious he from the table rose;
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
As many dinners I rehearse,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Too much Iâ€™m given to intersperse,
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
And also that my feeble verseâ€”
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Round which revolves the universe.
That for that matter in my verse
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
Detecting him the passing horse
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Most usually a Cossack horse
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
Departed, ordered out his horse
In age the memory gets worse,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Existence would not make a curse,
â€œHow dull you are this morning, nurse!â€
All visited him at first, of course;
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Of friends the grateful intercourseâ€”
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
Oh, many a year hath run its course
I lift a warning voice because
I once forgot for your sweet cause
The thirst for fame and manâ€™s applause,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
Now I am ready to refuse.
Whose memory doth not refuse
But look youâ€”ah! do not refuse.â€
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Poetic transport did infuse,
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
The monsters of the British Muse
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
But I the products of my Muse,
Now for the first time I my Muse
Incited by his stormy Muse
But I must now employ my Muse
Ye mothers also, caution use,
One instrument for his own useâ€”
Now, as in a deserted house,
Then became busy with the house,
â€œWhat can be drearier than the house,
Received him freely at her house,
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Night separated from her spouse,
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
I would your vigilance arouse,
The drum already doth arouse.
To my old nurse alone peruse,
But Olga would not such peruse.
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
But what results? His eyes peruse
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
They long ago had held debate.
They would not solemnly debate
My famous portrait indicate
But this amusement delicate
I marriedâ€”now, I supplicateâ€”
â€œAdvance!â€â€” Indifferent and sedate,
The Lovelaces are out of date,
All this I know is out of date,
That is, he could elucidate
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
He was most gay. The happy date
The story of thy life and fate.
Indifferent was her future fate.
On Lenskiâ€™s matrimonial fate
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
She muses: â€œWhat was Olgaâ€™s fate?
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
The servants used to congregate
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
The hostess doth interrogate:
He nears a spacious mansionâ€™s gate,
Both were expectant of the hate
â€œYour fashionable world I hate,
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
With her they did associate,
Both were of passion satiate
Excruciate the heart and late
(Like other things I could relate)
Sometime collected, shall relate
But if the truth I must relate,
â€œBut tell me, nurse, can you relate
â€œHe hath neglected us of late.â€â€”
The time for mystic strolls which late
Desirous to annihilate
In charming fashion mutilate?
How soon he learnt to titillate
But round the hostess scintillate
That year the autumn season late
Two hearts perchance were desolate
But now my mind is desolate,
Longtime was her heart desolate
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
A mild quotation to translate,
A promenade in twilight late
And you, O maids immaculate,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
But I came not to adulate:
The world enough. Congratulate
And jests doth recapitulate.
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Conscious of death approximate,
Just at the hour we designate
And, joy of souls effeminate,
By many a lamp illuminate,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Of life or death predestinate.
And stupid censors passionate;
Perchance one more affectionate.
He marmot-like did hibernate,
Must be pronounced unfortunateâ€”
And grasp a stirrup fortunateâ€”
â€™Tis fearful to anticipate
For evermore is separate.
The LÃ rinas would celebrate,
To whom your hearts were consecrate,â€”
To whom we used to consecrate
That chosen heroes consecrate,
Her manners were deliberate,
Spoiled children most degenerate
But merely to exasperate;
Or â€œIdol mio,â€ and in the grate
His double sashes and his grate,
If but to lighten Timeâ€™s dull rate,
When oâ€™er a glass with friends we prate
If cleverly or not I prate.
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
By an _obrokâ€™s_ indulgent rate:
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
With jealous fire resuscitate,
On thee I used to meditate!
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Perchance some heart â€™twill agitate,
The matter did not agitate,
Eternally to imitate
The secrets of the marriage state
By rank as settled by the State.
The sorrows of a single state.
These take their seats; the coach of state
I am not strong enough to state;
â€™Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
My heart of old would captivate.
My soul I cannot renovateâ€”
In bud of promise incomplete,
The weary way still incomplete,
Around my stanzas incomplete
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Without them Eugene is complete;
Encountered punishment complete,
Who the romance do not complete,
Who the romance do not complete,
With unanimity complete,
â€œMe?â€â€”â€œYes! It is Tattianaâ€™s fÃªte
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
The fervid poet would recite,
When poets lachrymose recite
Was certainly not erudite
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
A bottle of a vintage white
Winter resigned her empire white,
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
Its ebullition foaming white
All so distinct, and all so white!
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
The converse of the world polite,
Highways all Russia will unite
Happy who thereto can unite
The girl in marriage they unite.
Nor even tears afford respite,
I have endured without respite.
Trembles upon my lips from spite,â€”
A philosophic anchorite:
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
Who thrives this moment as I write,
But I must add to what I write
And madrigals Iâ€™m asked to write!
Beyond this may attempt to write_.
Serve who could neither read nor write.
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
And irritates the appetite.
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
By Olga stood, dejected quite
A Russian household simple quite,
Affection how did you requite?
Affection how did you requite?
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
For I myself was thirteen quite;
And town and friends forgotten quite.
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
The vestibule finds empty quiteâ€”
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Fond declarations they invite
On innocent delights I dote,
I on my chosen hero dote;
On balls I madly used to dote,
â€™Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
With â€œvaleâ€ finish off a note;
Or the delivery of a note.
Interrogation to denote.
She heard of servant-maids the note,
Your innocent and charming note
A dagger, asterisk, or note
To purest love he tuned his note
In spring-time, heard the cygnetâ€™s note
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
When in simplicity ye wrote
And an elegiac poem wrote.
But Lenski madrigals neâ€™er wrote
So let us to the ball-room haste,
And the attendants called in haste.
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
We must admit but little taste
All which in Paris eager taste,
More satisfaction to her taste.
And she despite herself would waste
And ease and fashionable waste,â€”
And education runs to waste,
This anchorite amid his waste
Subscribed, _toujours Ã  vous, Annette;_
With this unpleasant _tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte_,
And the cast-iron statuette
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
Device of rural minds acute!)
In the beginning, cold and mute,
From whose analysis minute
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
My countryâ€™s honour and repute
None could a trace of that impute,
Her all in all did constitute;
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
Did they not all the Russian tongue
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
OnÃ©guine knew enough, the rogue
Latin is just now not in vogue,
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
He racked his brains to find its clue
â€œAlas! my friend, no revenue!â€
His vanity first let us pique
Thou also, my ideal true,
Ah! it may be, affection true
â€™Tis time to marry her, â€™tis true,
No noveltyâ€”is it not true?â€”
No noveltyâ€”is it not true?â€”
â€œThen, in the country, isâ€™t not true?
â€œThen, in the country, isâ€™t not true?
I did not please you. Why pursue
I did not please you. Why pursue
For ever your Tattiana leave.
Without the faintest trace to leave
And all without her husbandâ€™s leave.
But now our hero we must leave
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
Into delicious bondage gave
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
Was it not so?â€”for thee I gave,
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
A first success light pinions gave,
Alarm the winter journey gave.
The prejudices all men have,
At his pale brow a shot to have,
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
Her shoulders, breast and face to laveâ€”
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
He sang of loveâ€”to love a slave.
To shallow sentiment a slave!
A prudent man like you and brave
The fatal secrets of the grave,
And blest me, sinking to the grave.
For him an honourable grave,
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
But where Melpomene doth rave
The moderns of the ancients raveâ€”
The Lord deliver her and save!
And thy inebriating wave
And her bespangled robe doth wave
Thus to assassinate the eve?â€â€”
But my OnÃ©guine the whole eve
To mention the foregoing eve,
Not the young timid maid, believe,
To standards in which we believe?
These are your relatives, believe:
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
Just at a moment which I grieve
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
He called upon me Christmas Eveâ€”
Shrill sang the _samovar_ at eve,
To jest as he had done last eve,
I love youâ€”to what end deceive?â€”
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
Where is he who doth not deceive?
And that too often we receive
What I by relatives conceive?
â€œNot at all.â€â€”â€œThat I canâ€™t conceive!
His son is married, just conceive!â€
In clouds of steam above perceive.
To write in cantos twenty-five.
To me he would his Olga give,
Of â€œcomme il faut.â€ ShishkÃ²ff, forgive!
Time without me will lessons give,
The most industrious man alive
Us from the world wherein we live.
Would whisper: shall I so long live?â€â€”
So meantime let him joyous live
Depart in peace and friendly live?
And our successors soon shall drive
Mutual destruction to contrive.
And yet he in your cause would strive
When that time comes, a poem Iâ€™ll strive
What boots it with the age to strive?
And loves you asâ€”a relative!
Applause, the peopleâ€™s donative.
I canâ€™t translate the adjective.
There our KatÃ¨nine did revive
Along the hall, and high above
That guests approach: and when above
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
None, be my witness Heaven above!
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
And enmity and hope and loveâ€”
Again the plague of boyhoodâ€”love?
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
The all-entrancing joys of loveâ€”
To swagger as the art of love,
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
Extendedâ€”haunt which Dryads love.
By absence who hath chilled his love,
I love you with a brotherâ€™s love,
With tears which secret sufferers loveâ€”
The malady of hopeless love
â€œIdeas and time neâ€™er backward move;
My spirit and my blood doth move,
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
Maidens before her meekly move
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
â€™Twas then he loved the tangled grove
A thick immense neglected grove
Around the meadow and the grove.
And in the Summer Garden rove.
Gently for pranks he would reprove
If Olga smilingly approve,
Time was when cold seduction strove
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
Desire to rule ye may observe
Polite demeanour to preserve,
To strike imagination serve.
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
Him who inspired both love and awe,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
Striking the intellect with awe
And supper. In the country we
When the hour came to bid good-byeâ€”
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
â€œYe peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
And reads with rapid eager eye
To raise his pistol to his eye,
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
Iâ€™ve scanned it with a jealous eye,
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
The cynosure of every eye.
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
OnÃ©guine whither gallops? Ye
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
On iron bridges we shall gaze
On everything around her gaze,
Looks upon all with absent gaze
And long her eyes as through a haze
Extinguished ashes do not blazeâ€”
No, never in the early blaze
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
â€œBut,â€ cried Zaretski in amaze,
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Let not the poetâ€™s spirit freeze,
Him a disquietude did seize,
A hand of ice appeared to seize
Nor the first snow of winter seize
The hero we immortalize.
Who now could fail to recognize
Who now could fail to recognize
Loveâ€™s pangs Tattiana agonize.
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
Having lost all in life we prize.
The calm existence which I prize
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
They made him feel inclined to doze;
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
And who is not a tiresome thief?
And honestly â€™tis my belief
Is ever ready with relief,
This great discovery relief
Habit alleviates the grief
Who in the agony of grief
To whom are our misfortunes grief
With deeper woe than othersâ€™ grief.
Our union would produce but grief.
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
Gvozdine, BouyÃ noff, PÃ©tÃ²ushkoff
The family of Kharlikoff,
But stop! I will present thee, if
To write of any other elf
Than oneâ€™s own fascinating self.
Then dressed himself...
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Even beneath her parentsâ€™ roof
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
The language of her girlish pleading
Page after page continued reading,
However, Taniaâ€™s letter reading,
But she, her sister never heeding,
Istomina(*) the nimbly-bounding;
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
â€œOh! how our years are vanishing!â€
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
OnÃ©guineâ€™s letter!â€â€”â€œAh! the thing!
I guard it as a holy thing,
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
Basins and jugsâ€”well! everything
Also one ViÃ¡zemski, remarking
And an old gent the poet marking
Shone pungent Satireâ€™s dauntless king,
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
But why are your cheeks whitening?â€
Iâ€™m oâ€™er it ever pondering.
The world is ever altering!
Ceased for a space all chattering.
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
Or, parable more flattering,
Amidst successes flattering
To our Tattiana conquering,
Upon the meadows showering,
Some other long-departed Spring,
Ye golden days of my young spring?
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
In life domestic see a string
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
That I forget not whom I sing.
Behold! orthography despising,
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,â€”
At last my father gave his blessing,
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
Attentive to the heartâ€™s first beating,
Follow up loveâ€”a secret meeting
To happiness contributing.
Wafted upon poetic wing,
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
Of pictures painful harrowing,
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
Metreless verses recognizing
Existence calmly sped along,
Who following Petrarch move along
A riding whip. She strolls along.
The days which to your youth belong?
But send your grandson before long.â€
Glittered in a perspective long,
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
She gazedâ€”a cue, forgotten long,
And grant success to labour long;
He thought to write, but labour long
The lively trash of stories long
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
The nightingale there all night long,
â€œ_The date, his fleeting years how longâ€”
Terpsichore alone among
And thus he never fell among
And wild festivities among
And oft at eventide a throng
He quits the fashionable throng
To whom amongst the jealous throng
â€œNothing, good nurse, thereâ€™s nothing wrong,
With little knowledge and that wrong
Repose in peace, thou child of song_.â€
She brought with her the gift of song.
And led me off to church with song.â€
Either with him or thee in song,
Springâ€™s paramour, pours forth her song
A double force unto their song
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Let me explain that in my song
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
Enough! my pack is now unslungâ€”
Since I beheld Eugene and young
â€œI celebrate a comrade young
Her sisterhood delights the young
Were you in love when you were young?â€â€”
Or letters of a maiden young.
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
Happy he who in youth was young,
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
His harp beneath that sky had rung
He who lifeâ€™s frosts which early wrung
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
The words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
His entrance with OnÃ©guine. â€œAh!
Make up your mind to go there.â€â€”â€œAh!
The native Russian tongue impeach?
Thus did our friend OnÃ©guine preach:
How meekly then I heard you preachâ€”
How meekly then I heard you preachâ€”
For Moscow fops and Circes each
To-day it is my turn to teach.
To-day it is my turn to teach.
Was the old and forgotten coach;
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
But ultimately doth approach.
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Did not their lips with foreign speech
Attentive listened to his speech,
Many an ancient legend which
Would she the canvas tight enrich
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
Who to surrender did not blench
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
But home his body to despatch
With gay design and silken stitch.
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
I formerly admired her much
No coquetry was there, I vouchâ€”
Youâ€™ll find her portrait there, I vouch;
Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
Society endures not such!
â€™Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
With great delight.â€”O God on high!
â€œI call to witness God on highâ€”â€
Sails her allotted course on high,
And many a caravan on high
The tiny sun shone less on high
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Careless of fame his spirit high
And from the misty woodland nigh
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
List! the snow crunchesâ€”he draws nigh!
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
When separationâ€™s hour drew nigh,
But finally she heaves a sigh,
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Heaved an involuntary sigh
There is no wreath upon the bough:
In scenes like these it may be though,
How dark the night is getting though!
His breast was riddled through and through,
And the eternal lorgnette through
To guess how you the eve pull through.â€â€”
My venerated reader, oh!
They sent their complimentsâ€”but oh!
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
And pressed her handâ€”the crimson blush
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
He lies, upon his forehead death,
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
Above the humble urn of death.
_Affectionately yours till death_.
Or counting on his uncleâ€™s death
Who early died a gallant death_,â€
When motionless your gaze beneath
â€œ_Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
Would agitate a mystic wreath
And what the old man might bequeath.
You oâ€™er your wine insulted hathâ€”
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
Impatient, boiling oâ€™er with wrath,
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
Or even overcome by wrath
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
Without the ken of parents both,
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
I must resign myself, in sooth;
But memory like a serpentâ€™s tooth
The dusty chronicles of earth
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
To dire contentment shall give birth
He salutary rules poured forth?
â€œDrive on!â€ the cheerful cry goes forth,
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
By the fine silver of the north.
For him were but of little worth,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
The last poor obol I was worthâ€”
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
To the impressions of our youth,
My frivolous and jolly youth.
Found the ideal of my youth,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
In that morass where you and I
My word of honour given have I.
But were it not immoral I
â€œNot in the least, assured am I!â€â€”
â€œMy darling, growing old am I!
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
But with her elder sister I
But who abandon itâ€”as I
But who abandon itâ€”as I
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
In former years thus did not I
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
His wadded coat and cap with peak
(Surely you know him as I speak);
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
Vows matrimonial to break,
Incessantly his chains to break.â€
A Russian in Childe Haroldâ€™s cloak,
Openly or â€™neath decent cloak.
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
Bruin is marching at her back!
And the sagacious Triquet back
Himself transformed into a hack;
Passes the torrent But alack!
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
In truth he had the happy trick
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quickâ€”
And he had made her heart beat quick!
He loved the simpleton to mock,
The artful prisoner should seek
And thus secures the prey we seek.
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
They have invited you this week.â€
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
He enters the saloon. â€™Tis blank!
And then a cup of coffee drank,
A door he opens. But why shrank
Heâ€™s a freemason, so we think.
An oval countenance and pink,
Yon silly moon upon the brink
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Vladimir closes up his book,
Was uttered, and the cabin shookâ€”
His fist OnÃ©guine fiercely shook
Into accounts would sometimes look,
But somehow there shone in his look
How bright and tender was his look,
To flight before her radiant look,
Calling to mind your icy look
Calling to mind your icy look
And shut him in a lonely nook.
The little solitary nook
His course unto the running brook.
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
â€™Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
How thoroughly her part she took!
And flowed harmoniously. He took
To ask her name the trouble took.
And clad in airy costume took
An honourable course ye took,
An honourable course ye took,
Jealousy and vexation took
Caught him and by the collar took
Till absently Vladimir took
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
But trembling on the mirror dark
The sad moon only could remark.
There, when the rains of spring we mark
â€™Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
Assemblies oligarchical
They deem her somewhat finical,
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Ye men of fashion cynical,
And female tears hysterical,
Already he grew phthisical.
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
Economy political,
A fop, in dress pedantical.
And cannot anything conceal,
Of untold gain she must conceal,
When the mazurka used to peal,
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
What sad emotions oâ€™er me steal
What will the coming dawn reveal?
For promises her feet reveal
Outlandish and provincial,
Her glance how wild yet genial!
And with gray hair ambrosial
Lo! with what pride celestial
Nought of its charms original
Yet suffering emotional
He deemed of human life the goal
The path which leads to gloryâ€™s goal.
And others rise ephemeral!
The eyes of a grave general.
Behind her a grave general.
A ball in Peterâ€™s capital,
In one thing really did excel.
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
When first upon my cheek I feel
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
On him spleen mounted sentinel
To suchâ€”delightful to repel.
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Until her powers of running fail.
Though of romance therein I fail
With eye precise and without fail.
In time Iâ€™ll give ye without fail
A substitute for lamps we hail!
Winterâ€™s approach she doth not hail
The sharp incisions of his nail,
Within its wave the sounding pail,
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
A true account and in detail.
Sorrow to counterfeit and wailâ€”
Herds low, and under nightâ€™s dark veil
God grant I meet not at a ball
Another tribune of the ball
To slay himself with blade or ball,
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
Yet as a rule their talk I call
She soon forgot, began to call
Was that which we are wont to call
So, when he came next day to call,
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
The rigour of cold pride and all
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
And finally he deigns let fall
They blossom, ripen and they fall
A whisper runs along the hall,
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Crush and confusion in the hall,
Some future ignoramus shall
Exclaiming, â€œWe must change â€™em all!
For long he had endured them all.
Nor years of separation all
Bedding is laid out and to all
Indifferent he became to all,
A white and undulating pall
The snow descends and buries all,
Her sentimental verses all,
The twilight pale which softens all,
â€™Tis now the season! Idlers all,
Morality taught scarce at all;
They shout and no one lists at all.
Was not surprised thereby at all.
He knits his browsâ€”â€™tis silent all.
I envied sore the billows tall,
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
Lord Byronâ€™s portrait on the wall
Hung like a print against the wall,
Shouts, laughter, jamming â€™gainst the wall,
Long in this fashionable cell
For consecrate to me he fell
The ladyâ€™s glance upon him fellâ€”
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
The inscription oâ€™er the gates of Hell
Repentance wields not now her spell
Of languor and of love did tell
â€™Twas not the first time, I can tell
For your instruction here to tell
The steward sent a note to tell
â€œI am in love,â€ her whispers tell
I amâ€”in loveâ€”you knowâ€”donâ€™t tell!â€
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tellâ€”
â€œHow are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
At thirty who was married well,
A worthy object â€™tis, and well
I have no leisure here to dwell,
Ennui can in the country dwell
And think: here lies who loved me well,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
And wished to say to him farewell.
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
â€œThe family are all quite wellâ€”
Are all your relatives quite well?
How thy hands burn!â€â€”â€œDear nurse, Iâ€™m well.
To take this letter to Oâ€” Well!
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
His relative and friend as well.
And gallicisms I love as well
And sometimes into snares as well
PÃ©tÃ²ushkoff, the provincial swell;
At twenty who was prig or swell,
â€œMy heartâ€™s delight, thou art not well.â€â€”
Your heart possesses, I know well,
OnÃ©guine acted very well
â€œBoredom, my friend, behold the illâ€”â€
My unpretending page shall fill,
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Proceeds, until she from a hill
The pervert world with icy chill
And wisely gallops to the hill.
Let us proceed unto a rill,
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
â€™Tis now the hillock now the rill
To listen to the rippling rill.
A garden by a shining rill.
â€œâ€™Tis habit, Lenski.â€â€”â€œIs your ill
An hour passed byâ€”anotherâ€”till,
His heart reciprocated still
The coach before a house stood still.
Domestic life attracts me still,
â€œHow now, OnÃ©guine, yawning still?â€â€”
Or couplets more ingenious still;
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
To wander through the meadows still,
With tumult or contentment still
You fall in love again. But stillâ€”
Time was, the poetâ€™s tender quill
No more at dawn the shepherd will
Thus a guest with composure will
(See the first canto if ye will),
To stay the maid against her will.
â€™Tis evidently Heavenâ€™s will
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
As in their turn the seasons roll.
Perchance they laurels also cullâ€”
But I, in love, was mute and dull.
Rings from a dish of water full
Perched on a gooseâ€™s neck a skull
In order due the maidens pull;
You know that I am now a foolâ€”
At eighteen not to play the fool!
He was a dear delightful foolâ€”
He used to hateâ€”and was no foolâ€”
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
Conventionalityâ€™s dull toolâ€”
Learn to possess more self-control.
â€œMonsieur lâ€™AbbÃ©â€ a starving Gaul,
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.
And Eugene ever in her soul
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
And now philanthropy his soul,
Now donâ€™t be cross with me, my soul,
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
Enchanted by the moonâ€™s pale beam.
Tattianaâ€™s eyes with tender gleam
And a boy handed round the cream.
The memory of the bard, a dream,
But Tania just as in a dream
Guards fondly hopeâ€™s uncertain dream.
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
Eugene at first began to dream,
The story of his young loveâ€™s dream,
To the fair object of his dream,
I will descant on loveâ€™s sweet dream,
But sweeter in a midnight dream
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
Eâ€™en from her cradleâ€™s earliest dream,
Tattiana in a misty dream,
Thouâ€™lt quaff loveâ€™s sweet envenomed stream,
Thinking to float upon the stream,
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Will be absorbed by Letheâ€™s stream;
Perish absorbed by Letheâ€™s stream.
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
Awaiting on the shore I roam
A wish from place to place to roam,
Back to his regiment must roam.
â€™Twould serve ye in an epigramâ€”
And a malicious epigram
And loveâ€™s delicious diadem
Merciful God, what will he deem?â€
Torquato Tassoâ€™s strains I deem.
â€™Tis something of this sort I deem.
Of priceless value all things seem
With mute appeal to ask they seemâ€”
He hath acquired the worldâ€™s esteem
But, as he never opened them,
In three weeks would arrive for them;
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
Is ever ready to proclaim
With such a perversity proclaim.
And true, his pistolâ€™s faultless aim
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
In winter by its blank and dim
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
And the lime alleyâ€™s twilight dim
Of what not, and of distant dim,
But could not. Then she questioned him:â€”
Silent, oracular yeâ€™d see him
Dared calmly cleanse his nails â€™fore him,
Where the first time she met with _him_.
Its driver seated on the rim
From first to last page to the rim.
He sang of separation grim,
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
A country damselâ€™s album trim,
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
In some a willing martyrdom.
â€œIs she in love?â€ quoth one. â€œWith whom?
She waited forâ€”I donâ€™t know whom!
PÃ©tÃ²ushkoff met the selfsame doom.
Thus age approached, the common doom,
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!â€â€”
Her health, lifeâ€™s sweetness and its bloom,
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
The forests in mysterious gloom
This is my masterâ€™s sitting-room.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
â€œHad he been long here, and where from?
She nerves herself from her alarm
And leans upon the monsterâ€™s arm,
The amatory science warm,
In thy imagination warm,
Fantastic images shall swarm
Laid down his life of sun and storm
A Russian poemâ€™s mechanism
Distinctly not its mechanism.
And I discerned through Fancyâ€™s prism
Indeed, by force of magnetism
How like a poet was my chum
He â€œBenedettaâ€ used to hum,
He had excepted from the ban:
Dressing as quickly as he can,
Meantime Iâ€™ll finish whilst I can
Romances three, in which ye scan
â€™Twas plainâ€”an oaken floor ye scan,
A new acquaintance we must scan.
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
OnÃ©guine slowly then began
And my Tattiana now began
Zaretski, village mechanician,
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
Iâ€™ve thought well oâ€™er the general plan,
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
â€œHow came you then to wed a man?â€â€”
Vladimirâ€™s property, a man
At last became a ruined man.
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
Let me present ye to the man,
He was an honest gentleman,
Long ceased to be a reading man,
_Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
Portrayed contemporary man
Eugene directs the trusty man
Four deadly paces do they span;
Deep into debt his father ran;
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
â€œWhy, as God ordered! My Ivan
But when Tattianaâ€™s hand had taâ€™en
And satisfied with vengeance taâ€™en.
A friendly hand thy life hath taâ€™en!
Away, Tattiana, hath been taâ€™en.
But scarce had maids their saucers taâ€™en
Portray the solitary den
Perchance upon the Neva eâ€™en
In her friendsâ€™ albums, time had been,
There friends of pure delight had been
Assuredly should not have been
The butt of scandal having been,
Had a deluded victim been
Obedient she had ever been
And fields my joys have ever been;
Which never have existed, eâ€™en
â€œCome,â€ she cried, â€œsister, tell me eâ€™en
My joy in youth was fleeting eâ€™en
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
Repose from labour, satire keen,
What a storm of emotions keen
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
Was nothing but the British spleen
The lonely mansion-house to screen
It blew: it howled: till winter eâ€™en
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
As your light footprints on the green.
In springtime on the meadows green,
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
To this arrangement can be seen,
Nor precepts sage nor pictures eâ€™en,
Similar dames ye may have seen.
Whom you in slumber may have seen.â€
The torment born of crime unseen,
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,â€â€”
From gales a hill behind was seen;
Before him red roast beef is seen
But nothing changed in them is seen,
Philosopher just turned eighteen.
In little maidens of thirteen?
His malady, whose cause I ween
Writ in my honour now and thenâ€”
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
â€œOnÃ©guine, I was younger then,
â€œOnÃ©guine, I was younger then,
His friendship I acquired just then;
The cold reply with gloomy mien
The tale of these romantic men;
To pass with reasonable men
_E sempre bene_, gentlemen!
Amid submissive herds of men
Whom, as the custom is of men,
Having abjured the haunts of men,
And isolated from all men,
So inaccessible to men,
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
The poet fell; already men
Yawning betook him to a pen.
I know that Parnyâ€™s tender pen
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Another his betrothed was given;
The imagination to enliven
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
By sympathy I have been driven.
The memory of the bard was driven
OnÃ©guine was a citizen
How deftly could he transport feign!
An exile from their troublous reign,
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
How bitterly he would malign,
With roses, caps and looks malign;
Dreading the worldâ€™s remarks malign,
All bustle when he makes a sign:
Landscapes thereon he would design,
At times talk nonsense with design;
Men opposite. The cross they sign
My gratitude do not disdain,
Listen to me without disdain.
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
Should dearly like a dance again.
Shall I behold thee once again?â€â€”
But to the garden once again
The youthful lover once again
OnÃ©guine, bored to death again,
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
OnÃ©guineâ€”take him up againâ€”
That until Christmas comes again
Of love again, and yet again;
A maid hath oft, may yet again
And agitate my heart again;
Or if he meant to flirt again,
It wakens in my breast again.
Tattiana courage doth regain
By an avowal just as plain.
He there is masterâ€”that is plain;
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Detest him for a brother slain?
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
By whom the youthful bard was slain?â€â€”
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Would she in silence long remain.
As deaf and silly doth remain,
He obstinately will remain,
And gave himself but little pain
And thus it is â€™twould cause me pain
Me now, inflict upon me pain?â€”
Me now, inflict upon me pain?â€”
And an habitual sense of pain;
Spare yourself unavailing pain
â€œMy darling child, thou art in pain.â€”
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
I know not if his heart felt pain
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
The bardâ€™s enthusiastic strain,
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
After the wedded couple strain;
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrainâ€”â€
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
The dream left terror in its train.
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
Or eâ€™en the â€œDemonâ€ of my strain.
Tania the meaning would obtain
A case of books he doth obtainâ€”
I loved youâ€”what did I obtain?
I loved youâ€”what did I obtain?
My light productions to retain,
Although her book did not contain
The household property contain:
His daughterâ€™s book to ascertain
Pair after pair the race sustain.
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
And distance interposed in vain,
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
He reads at random, reads in vain.
And far removed from rumour vain;
And far removed from rumour vain;
Iâ€™ve wasted in amusements vain,
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
The converse of our hermits twain,
To raise a clamour and a din:
In solitude or worldly din,
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Ere conversation could begin,
But by degrees the crowd begin
For Godâ€™s sake, Lenski, donâ€™t begin!
With words of foreign origin
The pall of night was growing thin,
At morn an icy bath within
He heard his soulâ€™s complaint within,
Still everywhere, without, within,
Whereâ€”â€â€”â€œWhat! another eclogue spin?
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Pardon I ask for such a sinâ€”
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
In books he saw nought to condemn
â€œHere, he resides with Simeon.
A canine face with horns thereon,
And that unrivalled paragon,
And gossip of the town and fashion
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
The torrent of opinion,
Behold! the worldâ€™s opinion!
But Tania neâ€™er displayed a passion
The natural fickleness of passion,
The youthful poetâ€™s fond confession.
Shall abdicate the bardâ€™s profession,
My friends, what means this odd digression?
With quite a lachrymose expression
He enters: rapidly discussion
Who without more prevarication
We all of us of education
OnÃ©guine went with trepidation
Tattiana saw with trepidation
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
But Eugene, hating litigation
With inexact pronunciation
And tears of reconciliation:
Tattiana was her appellation.
Although it will not bear translation,
A coquette loves by calculation,
Upon her cheek by adulation
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
Not high in general estimation;
Enhances love in estimation
And hot with jealous indignation,
And sulked in silent indignation;
Of such a dread hallucination.
Invigorate imagination
Long time her young imagination
Original imagination,
She did not think â€œprocrastination
Of foreign whims the impersonationâ€”
Triumphant by anticipation,
Their Jealousy and separation
The fair of the next generation,
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
And eye which gleams with inspirationâ€”
And thou, youthâ€™s early inspiration,
The idols of their adoration
In pages of a love narration
The hero is of my narration!
The poetâ€™s fervid conversation
Introduce verse in conversation.
A charm with it in conversation.
Without constraint in conversation
Not knowing its interpretation,
Alone within his habitation
A Vampire fond of meditation,
An innate love of meditation,
And buried deep in meditation,
As formerly much agitation.
And long internal agitation
And marking Taniaâ€™s agitation,
A love which knew no limitation,
Which is he? or an imitation,
Thy meditative incantationâ€”
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
Amid a serious disputation,
Seeing in this no deprivation,
To the sarcastic observation,
By what idea or observation
With intellect and strong volition
Meantime OnÃ©guineâ€™s apparition
Lenski the foemanâ€™s apparition
Quite a sensation; the position
My very latest composition!
And a determined disposition,
For journalistic deglutition
The same unmoved oblivion
Rescue me from oblivion.
Was worthy of that old baboon,
Beneath the silver of the moon
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
And bends her mirror on the moon,
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
â€™Tis silentâ€”on her shines the moonâ€”
And now â€™tis night, the guardian moon
â€œWhy did you leave last night so soon?â€
Submissive as if in a swoon,
His wife was also mad upon
Our fathers used to dote upon;
Without disgust we look upon?
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
His spirit was intent upon.
Herself not knowing well the reason,
The counsel good and full of reason,
And the cold beauties of the season:
To visit Moscow in the season.
She was thus fond of Richardson
The works of Mr. Richardson.
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
Or that adoring Grandison
Was certainly no Grandison.
Cousin, remembâ€™rest Grandison?â€
Sailed silently in unisonâ€”
There an imperious skeleton;
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
To write his forefathers to warn
He eyed her with a fond concern,
Tattianaâ€”thus the sex is born.â€”
He seemed for matrimony born.
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
Silvers the brook; the shepherdâ€™s horn
A jolly song and distant horn;
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
Which â€™neath her pillow lay till morn.
And sallied forth one brilliant mornâ€”
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
Perchance you also soon may burn,
My wretched Lenskiâ€™s fate I mourn,
Do we alone our losses mourn
To visit, lovely maid, return,
Delighted glances in return;
Have entered never to return.
Or, heedless of the leavesâ€™ return
Then to some gallant in your turn
Men will forget me, but my urn
â€œBut lo! forth from the valleys dun
To freeze his finger hath begun,
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Swift following in her wake, the sun,â€
Across the smiling face of dawn.
And dream of lifeâ€™s delightful dawn?
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
As when the tempestâ€™s veil is drawn
In silence shall I sit and yawn
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
And on the footstool sitting down
And at the table sat her down.
And the fair sex as light as down!
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
Approach, approach; I am thine own.â€
The aged nurse in ample gown,
In a half-open dressing-gown
You never since your nose have shown.
Thus her perversity hath shown.
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
But, to his uncleâ€™s mansion flown,
The opportunity is flown.
For summer to the country flown,
Fresh aspirations I have known,
Still happier he who neâ€™er hath known!
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Besides, a duellist well-known
For oâ€™er a word to fashion known,
What everybody long has known;
He is not there: I am not known:
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
She bows her head beneath the crown;
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
Have one by one all withered grown
Have latterly vexatious grown;
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
â€œIdeal,â€ he had drowsy grown.
Slept oâ€™er the river misty grown.
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
She hesitates, in doubt is thrownâ€”
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strownâ€”
This northern summer of our own,
When will the devil take his own!â€
Impelled to union with his own
Far from his Italyâ€”his own.
And the young damsel from the town,
Troyâ€™s sages should in concert own
He left _you_ first, and I must own
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
But tell me what am I to do?
Which we experienced long ago.
Familiar to him long ago.
Made me so tipsy long ago!
To romp and play she neâ€™er would go:
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
They hand in hand to table go.
Whither at headlong speed doth go
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall goâ€”
Whither that evening he will go.
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
â€œGood-bye, OnÃ©guine, I must go.â€â€”
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
But say he was a genius who
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
His daily occupations, lo!
I cannot understand. But lo!
â€œIs he known to you?â€â€”â€œYes and No.â€
â€œAnd is it she? It must beâ€”noâ€”
Present me.â€â€”â€œYou are joking.â€â€”â€œNo.â€â€”
More troublesome than usual?â€â€”â€œNo!
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
Pen, paper bring: the table too
And usually despised it too),
My beauty, thou art ready too.
Yet let us part in friendship, O
But would not look at Cicero.
â€œToâ€”?â€â€”â€œLÃ rina.â€â€”â€œTattiana?â€â€”â€œSo.
Inspired him with disgust and so
â€œShall we commence?â€â€”â€œLet it be so,â€
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
And so my noon hath come! If so,
â€œIâ€™m happy, say, is it not so?â€â€”
No more remembered him; unto
For was it not her duty to
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
Together moments one or two
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Or a professor in tulle cap.
The lady in the crimson cap
When captured in a schoolboyâ€™s cap;
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
Which oâ€™er the waters boldly leap,
Heâ€™s a straightforward little chap.â€
Or at a promenade mayhap,
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
With iridescent wing doth flap
And all in snow is buried deep.
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
Mountains weâ€™ll level and through deep
Buried in meditation deep,
Long time in meditation deep
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
But stares into the darkness deep.
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
The maids beside Tattiana keepâ€”
Her path across the plain doth keepâ€”
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
Where is OnÃ©guine? Half asleep,
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Far from the rest the pair would creep
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
The sun had mounted high his steep,
Across the stage still madly sweep,
Girls in anticipation skip!
Like down from Aeolusâ€™s lip,
With one foot resting on its tip
The sudden rattling of a car.
Since in these arms I thee did bearâ€”
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
All are constrained and fetters bear,
To the assembly her they bear.
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
_Come to my golden palace, dear_!
I canâ€™t conceive a little dear
His cup unto his maiden dear.
Even as the love of children dear.
Of roses to romancers dear;
Or eâ€™en Istomina, my dear,
Not only sorrowâ€”Ah! my dear,
And since I pulled thee by the earâ€”
As in some frenzied dream of fear
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
The path of hope and tender fearâ€”
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
She will not see, she will not hear.
A smile from slumbering nature clear
There is a spot the village near
With sad refrain misfortune near.
And dost thou know her?â€â€”â€œWe live near.â€
A friar black approaching near,
Epistles of six sheets or near,
A lady draws the hostess near,
Mysteriously all objects near
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
When youthâ€™s rebellious hour drew near
He daily in his drives drew near
Shy, silent did the maid appear
But still more stupid did appear
Do me a favour and appear.
So irremissible appear?
Would at the proper time appear.
Love to inspire doth woe appear
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
Never for me to reappearâ€”
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Unknown to all he doth appear,
Go, on the Nevaâ€™s bank appear,
For which no springtime shall appear?
But as to fightingâ€”â€™twill appear!
Two dressed in uniform appearâ€”
Doth in us or our names appear
The shining orbs of night appear;
â€œHow Tania grows! Doth it appear
More advantageously appear
A vision desolate and drear
In the dawn of existence drear.
The aspect of a landscape drear.
The coming of lifeâ€™s Autumn drear.
He bending whispered in her ear
And breathe a drama in his ear.
Modest yet daring! And a tear
The simple epitaphâ€”a tear
Oâ€™er my remains to drop a tear,
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Old women at the coachmen swear.
For us, may be for many a year.
Long ago?â€â€”â€œâ€™Tis the second year.â€
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
And from the Millionaya afar
And grown more curious by far
Unhappily too salt by far;
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
Malek Adel and De Linar,
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And hat surnamed a â€œBolivarâ€
As in the timid forest deer,
And exclamations and good cheer.
Though hitherto a lady neâ€™er
Gliding in negligent career,
Amid the company career.
â€œAt LÃ rinaâ€™s.â€â€”â€œHem, that is queer!
To lawless love I should preferâ€”
To lawless love I should preferâ€”
â€œWell!â€â€”â€œI the elder should prefer,
Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.
Romance of love I pray refer,
And traces with a slender finger
Tania doth by the casement linger
Adroitly seized and carried her;
And like a shadow haunted her.
â€œThe younger, youâ€™re in love with her!â€
Doth loveâ€™s incautiousness in her
Unfavourable unto her.
He leisurely adorns for her.
Not a bad fellow was her father
Though superannuated rather;
To Eve the universal mother,
Recent instructions of its mother.
Gravely repeating to another
Aye bids ye in some way or otherâ€”
But finally grew bored by her.
Servant of God and brigadier,
On waves by tempests curdled oâ€™er!
His bit with foam besprinkled oâ€™er,
Together we have wandered oâ€™er
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl oâ€™er.
Now her lithe form she arches oâ€™er
So ancient warriors, battles oâ€™er,
Spanned the unbridled torrent oâ€™er;
Where dwelt the Musesâ€™ worshipper,
Malicious and a slanderer.
And courtier, fop, and usurer
Confront thy fated torturer!
Iâ€™ll sprinkle thee with holy water.â€”
This was his social character.
What is his latest character?
â€œThe Lord be with thee, O my daughter!â€â€”
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
Iâ€™m beaten in another matter;
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
At Russ she was by no means clever
Appear; along the road of Tver
Hope with her fascinating power
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
Is occupied with Olga fair,
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
Books he abandoned like the fair,
To clank the spur, delight the fairâ€”
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
Describe in detail the affair,
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Pray is it not a tough affair
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
I have dreamed many a vision fair
The gossip of their ladies fair.
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
Is it not true? the objects fair,
The less we love a lady fair
I uttered to my lady fair
With the epistle of my fair;
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
and with dishevelled hair,
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
A kerchief round her silver hair
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
But with confused and bashful air,
And vanish like a bird in air.
Finally tost his arms in air
And the SkatÃ¨nines, aged pair,
Approaches Olga and the pair
Around the carriage of the pairâ€”
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
He knows Kaverine will repair.
The freshness of her heart impair,
Yet still remains the old despair.
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
Accents of rapture or despair
Lo! my OnÃ©guine free as air,
_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;
Urging your droshkies swift as air
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
Mark ye with what a modest air
Flies past the porter to the stair,
â€™Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_â€
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
And FliÃ noff, pensioned councillor,
But gray Phillippevna the door
She cannotâ€”Eugene oped the door
She peeped through a chink of the door.
Olga ran skipping from the door.
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Anicia soon appears, the door
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
Upon the ball-roomâ€™s glassy floor
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
Lest the malicious reader or
Is petted by the Emperor?â€”
Is petted by the Emperor?â€”
Some one or other editor
Opens unto her visitor.
And wheresoeâ€™er thy footsteps err,
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
And sermonâ€”but in that dread hour
And sermonâ€”but in that dread hour
Impressionable for an hour,
I blame not your behaviourâ€”
I blame not your behaviourâ€”
And at the stages bugs and fleas
PÃ©lagie Nikolavna has
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
OnÃ©guine firedâ€”Alas! alas!
In this case quite mistaken was.
Still of his club he member wasâ€”
With purple hand Aurora leads,
With tranquil air OnÃ©guine leads
His wife approaches, with him leads
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
That crass stupidity misleads,
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
She the delicious novel reads,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
If they but heard domestic loads
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
And all that from thy hand proceedsâ€”
â€œThen come with me.â€ The prince proceeds,
Already dance to song proceeds;
And rising from her bench proceeds;
And a grand festival proceeds.
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
Professions eagerly for deeds,
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
â€™Twas eve. â€™Twas dusk. The river speeds
To bring behind: the triple steeds
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
Are ye replaced by other maids
Tattiana to a corner, bids
And gradually day unfolds.
In winter, when Night longer holds
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
His son and mortgages his lands.
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Obedient to warm Springâ€™s commands.
Thus in the earth the seed expands
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
The father scarcely understands
Where each young critic ready stands,
With bated breath, around she bends
The avalanche of snow first bends,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
Tattiana from the hill descends
Then glittering in the sun descends.
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
Of frivolous existence, friends;
Triumphsâ€”their own or those of friendsâ€”
Iâ€™ve had to make for having friends!
Against my inclination, friends,
Existence without wife or friends,
The feet of my dear lady friends.
Their harmless conversation blends
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
His hate by slander, and who spends
And care but little for its ends.
On us beyond the grave attends,
O feet, whereâ€™er your path extends
With love which happiness extends;
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Scarce to her questions he responds,
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
Appear attuned to softer chords;
And wild among them grew her wordsâ€”
At least their accents and their words
Of passion reminiscences,
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
My goddesses, where are your shades?
â€™Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
â€œAdieu! thou home where peace abides,
Tattiana motionless abides.
The unbidden guests he roughly chidesâ€”
And supercilious dames she glides,
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
A crab upon a spider rides,
Sits down and gazes on all sidesâ€”
Of migratory gipsy hordesâ€”
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Whom autocratic fateâ€™s decrees
May be that I by heavenâ€™s decrees
To understand by slow degrees
The serpent to unlawful trees
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
Not the least trace OnÃ©guine sees
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
And nothing more important sees;
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
She fears and like an arrow rushes
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
And all thy precious elegies,
Around the garden homeward hies.
And overcome antipathies
The shutters open; to the skies
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Where all upon the surface lies,â€”
Slumber still oâ€™er him lingering flies.
Look through the window and kill flies.
From hall to yard and garden flies,
Tattiana to the index flies
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
Oâ€™erwhelmed with guests; by families
When the same life before him lies
What moreâ€™s required? The world replies,
Ever to hear the same replies
All breathless and without replies.
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
A sportsman who in covert lies.
Had come both friends and enemiesâ€”
His friends and also enemies
And the bad book accompanies.
The general who accompanies.
Thrice happy who their agonies
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
She from the winter corn espies
Some a mazurka occupies,
He roars, and â€œAh!â€ Tattiana cries.
â€™Tis silent all! Alone the cries
Upon those pages she descries
Even the rosy wafer dries
Past palaces and nunneries,
In the worldâ€™s mortal revelries,
To peer into the future tries.
And alphabetically tries
My splendid house and gaietiesâ€”
From public and from private ties,
Than cold OnÃ©guineâ€™s oddities,
At neighbouring hospitalities.
And fashionâ€™s gay frivolities;
I yield for splendid vanities,
The gilding of lifeâ€™s vanities,
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Spared him not their asperities.
The country hath its liberties
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The guests make room; aside each takes
He now a full possession takes,
Without grammatical mistakes.
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
May be, and this my terror wakes,
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
His recent glory he invokes.
Also, to equalise the scales,
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
She got a book of nursery tales,
The coach is borne oâ€™er ruts and holes,
â€™Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
But lights incendiary flames
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
To banish far unworthy themes
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
And due precautions take betimes.
Alas! he loved as in our times
I sail upon my lake at times
And the young revellers of past times
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
The fisherâ€™s fire afar illumes
Whom pale Dianaâ€™s ray illumesâ€”
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
Attentive be unto my rhymes
And an enchanting shoulder shines
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Her head upon her breast declines
Upon her elbow she reclines,
Longer the East inert reclines
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
Wherein love innocently pines.
The golden ember now enshrines,
And fashionable magazines,
And now he views forgotten foes,
Yes! every one must have his foes,
Now, like hereditary foes,
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
And meditative homeward goes,
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
All arise. To the door he goes.
Into the tangled garden goes
All vanished as an echo goes.
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
Between the stalls, along the toes;
The accents wild of otherâ€™s woes,
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
He fixedly upon her staresâ€”
The husband comes and interferes
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
Imaginationâ€™s sacred fires,
And still the coachmen round the fires
As with innumerable fires.
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Compassion now or wrath inspires
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
And where tempestuous loveâ€™s desires,
And now his youthful heart desires
And of the irksome harness tires,
Jackdaws on every spireâ€”in scores.
Seated, a curious look with glasses
Shouts of applause! OnÃ©guine passes
In true interpretation hates:
And slowly life coagulatesâ€”
Which in your spirit dominates,
But wretched who anticipates,
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fÃªtes;
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
_Quâ€™ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
And what like menaces fatigues,
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Which shines with iridescent hues.
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
A victim decked with golden leaves;
All which caprice and affluence craves,
Across the Balticâ€™s salt sea waves,
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He rings in haste; in haste arrives
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
Beats that of friends and relatives:
Our liberty at least survives:
She the acquaintances she loves,
To the pianoforte he moves
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
And various chords upon it proves,
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
At the same hour she oped her eyes
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
But finally he oped his eyes
Olga he sees before his eyes
Where every day before his eyes
For tallow, wood and other things
His travels like all other things
_The peasants there are rich as kings,
But still remembrance to him clings,
All that industrial London brings
All this in many cases brings
Happy and glorious_. But this brings
And now she skips and now she springs
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
Obedient to the magic strings,
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
Slow circling round its fellow swings
The time between the wolf and dogsâ€”
How pleasantly the evening jogs
Along the Nevaâ€™s bank he sleighs,
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Goddess of loversâ€™ tender sighs.
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
Exceptionless as no rule is,
Calmly her eyes encounter hisâ€”
Calmly her eyes encounter hisâ€”
Eugene, more tolerant than this
And deem the world perfection is!
â€œOh! what a fool our neighbour is!
I just hint, in parenthesis,
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?â€â€”
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
The old man who has had his freaks,
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
However, the mazurka lacks
For the first time the hammer clicks.
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
Dianaâ€™s bosom, Floraâ€™s cheeks,
The princeâ€™s eye OnÃ©guine seeks:
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
A horseâ€™s hoofs she hearsâ€”She shrinks!
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
But nowâ€”my very blood congeals,
But nowâ€”my very blood congeals,
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
May yet be studious of his nails;
And beckon to the passing sails.
Custom the despot soon prevails.
The early tinkling of the bells
Which of approaching labour tells
When the sonorous BrÃ©guet tells
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Impelled by Springâ€™s dissolving beams,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
And the heartâ€™s agitated dreams.
For rural solitude and dreams,
And where Thalia softly dreams
To agitate me in my dreams.
Descended swift in turbid streams
And where the admirable streams
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
Their memory lingers still and seems
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
And heedless of approval seems,
Awhile sound conversation seems
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
And more imagination teems.
Glory with which our history teems
Of conversation, thought and aimsâ€”
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
When evening oâ€™er the landscape looms,
In Olgaâ€™s and Tattianaâ€™s rooms
A windmill too a jig performs
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
Insensible her hand remains
Insensible her hand remains
His kneeling posture he retainsâ€”
His kneeling posture he retainsâ€”
Barking, young ladiesâ€™ osculations,
Priams of country populations
And dames of fine organisations,
Old peopleâ€™s simple conversations
Their offspringâ€™s innocent flirtations
Latest arrivalsâ€™ salutations,
They were the wonderful traditions
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
Had finished life amid his sons,
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
With flame more ardent passion burns,
Her heart importunately turns.
But to OnÃ©guine! _A propos!_
All covered up with snow in heaps,
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
In country towns, where still it keeps
â€™Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
A little virgin mirror peeps.
And lonely through the forest creeps.â€
I will not wed, and ever weeps
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
The two friendsâ€™ compliments she hears
With smiling face he Lenski hears;
Without participation hears,
Although the destined coffin nears,
The silent fields no peasant nears,
She calm and unconcerned appears.
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Tattiana in the yard appears
Mournful Loveâ€™s deadly trace appears
All in the good old style appears,
Nearer they comeâ€”Eugene appears!
With his ferocious mate appears.
Distracted by her grief appears
And what from its recess appears?
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
And to these letters and these tears.
And to these letters and these tears.
Her weary eyes are filled with tearsâ€”
Likewise an epitaph with tears
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
For visions of my childish years
For visions of my childish years
With Eugene pranks of former years
(So â€™twas with us in former years,
For dolls, eâ€™en from her earliest years,
The solstice of our earthly years,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Have shone as one of fashionâ€™s leaders.
OnÃ©guine, O my gentle readers,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
But foolsâ€”their calumnies and sneersâ€â€”
Old age through spectacles too peers,
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
And judgment which unsteady veers
Tattiana certainly infers
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
She neâ€™er repeated unto hers.
Epicurean philosophers,
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Youth freshens beneath Passionâ€™s showers,
â€™Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
Of Levshinâ€™s school ye followers,
Develops and matures its powers,
Nor boston nor the worldâ€™s affairs
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
To the theatre he repairs
He to the festival repairs,
â€™Tis day, the family downstairs,
A moment effervescing stirs,
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
Balconies, lionâ€™s heads on doors,
And hated casual visitors,
And the kind-hearted servitors:
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
And where a madrigal occurs
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
Judge then what roses would be ours,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
The manners of the highest class
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And from his dressing-room would pass
By bee and butterfly which pass.
Both day and night he now must pass
And lo! five paces more they pass,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Divinity without access
Yet satiated with success,
There was no angling for success.
In the worldâ€™s vortex my success,
Tattiana in the young princess!
Tattiana in the young princess!
Trembling he seeks the young princessâ€”
But the indifferent princess,
Thus oftâ€”this I myself confessâ€”
And now, I mournfully confess,
â€œIf the domestic hearth could blessâ€”
Me your perfections would not bless;
Also their feetâ€”yet neâ€™ertheless
How flourish, why and wherefore less
With fir-trees standing motionless
Speech was so tame and colourless
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Men become friends from idleness.
To loiter there in idleness
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
Her heart how full of gentleness,
A child devoid of childishness
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
In melancholy loveliness,
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
And contemplative dreaminess;
He _cannot_ give me happiness.â€
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
â€œâ€™Twas possible then, happinessâ€”
â€œBut strange am I to happiness;
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Oppressive now is happiness,
With laughter smothered weariness:
And freezing fits of weariness.
All sons of mental weariness.
Their slander eâ€™en was weariness;
In old age life is weariness!â€
Amid the awful emptiness
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
In rhyming I show laziness.
Attractive in its banefulness?
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
Where my days in the wilderness
Aroused in him some tenderness.
With spiritual tenderness;
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
The bays of age and helplessness.
My lot is fixedâ€”with thoughtlessness
Is it that human restlessness
â€œOnÃ©guine, all this sumptuousness,
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Await the long-delayed caress.
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Whose hands indulgently caress
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
Conquer by passion and address,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
To array himself in evening dress.
Meantime in matutinal dress
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Or kiss the border of her dress.
But Eugene long hath left the press
A young Armidaâ€™s lips to press,
She hears the bear behind her press,
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
She starts, nor doth a word express,
She starts, nor doth a word express,
To fawn upon and love express;
Wherefore regarding him express
I like the difference to express
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Inflict annoyance and distress
Her agitation and distress
Loveâ€™s tender transports and distress,
And though I read it with distress,
Habit was given us in distress
Nor discontinued to distress
Hymenâ€™s embarrassments, distress,
A strong resemblance these possessâ€”
Tattianaâ€™s letter I possess,
If wife and children to possess
If the raw product they possess
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
This gentle daring who could guess?
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Could not in that brief moment guess!
The uncontaminated kiss
Have felt loveâ€™s agitated kiss
Beneath his lipsâ€™ devouring kiss.
Beneath his lipsâ€™ devouring kiss.
A ladyâ€™s hand doth never kiss.
This evanescent boyish bliss.
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,â€”
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
Even amusing fools we miss
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
Can count the time without much fussâ€”
Beside the thundering abyss
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
As every journal now entreats,
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
And stay whose length none recollects.
In the meantime the mill inspects.
Leaning against the dam expects,
Their coming which no man expects,
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Whom latterly one often meets
Along Saint Petersburgâ€™s paved streets,
Though without palaces and streets,
Past darkened windows and long streets
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
And oh! what verses, what delights,
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
With rapturous longing he awaits,
Will teach grammatical conceits,
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
And his poor basten sandal knits.
As formerly the shepherd sits
The maiden at her casement sits
Its splendour and its blandishments,
But, after mutual compliments,
The epistle from the bard presents.
She visited the humble tents
The hours once more OnÃ©guine counts,
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
A rivulet beneath them shoots
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
Ever receive with kindly hearts
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
We Russians, friends from distant parts
The Paris of those country parts
Deliberate approach of guests
Variety of speech and vests,
Though for his Helen Menelaus
And like Napoleons each of us
The stomach doth admonish us.
A million bipeds reckons thus
Corneilleâ€™s majestic genius,
Whereto in language courteous
Yea! although rendered beauteous
A critic of the stage malicious,
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
A slave of actresses capricious,
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
The conversation tedious
Oh! who is not calumnious?
There Didelot became glorious,
She seemed of him oblivious,
By such allusions scandalous,
By Tolstoyâ€™s pencil marvellous,
With satisfaction marvellous,
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
How mean, how pusillanimous!
Amid sly, pusillanimous
The drive becomes monotonousâ€”
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
Thou also, reader generous,
Then ye were barely generous,
It was a cheery, generous
He shunned those parties boisterous;
Abandon cities riotous,
Well! LÃ rina appears to us
Who labours hard to humour us?
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
The friend of liberty and laws
I long have ceased to offend the laws.
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
His watch, the sun in turn he viewsâ€”
Perverse, unfavourable views?
And through the lofty windows views
To male acquaintances he bows,
The men salute with lower bows
The epitaph on marble shows:
With all dissatisfaction shows.
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
Mends with the Russian hammerâ€™s blows
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
When Passionâ€™s fire no longer glows
Before a fire which feebly glows
And this the faithful one allows,
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
And all the joys which Winter knows.
For otherwiseâ€”God only knows!
The first appearance of the snows
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
Upon the dreary northern snows,
Through dense aristocratic rows
On unknown female forms he throws.
The connoisseur his glances throws
Oâ€™er hillock and oâ€™er meadow throws.
From boxes or from stalls in rows.
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestowsâ€”
And I confess that now-a-days
But even thus not now-a-days!
Of fiery youthâ€™s untutored days
To vary for a few brief days.
Alas! the friend of childish days
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
We called to mind our youthful daysâ€”
That vanished are my youthful days
As the sins of my youthful days
As partner of my mournful days,
The very morning of our days.
Companion of my childhoodâ€™s days.
O triumphs of my guileless days,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
In one of thine enchanting lays
Consisting of harmonious lays,
Or Bogdanovitchâ€™s sweet lays.
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
No more with pale Dianaâ€™s rays,
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Alas! my stomach it betrays
When he in ardent verse portrays
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
OnÃ©guine his excuses says;
Till the mazurkaâ€™s close he stays,
Or parody of modern ways?
But soon she altered all her ways,
Delighted much his former ways
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
And hates the worldâ€™s discordant ways.
Unto Anicia for the keys
The household troop of little boys,
A joyous troop of little boys
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Who cannot conjure former joys?
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
Ere this but one brief moment beat
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Age immature averse to cheatâ€”
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
And boiling oâ€™er with friendly heat,
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
With loversâ€™ rubbish filled, was neat
And in a whisper did repeat:
The passionate speeches Iâ€™ll repeat,
I mean my name not to repeat.â€
I might to connoisseurs repeat
Which lessons unto us repeat,
A hundred times will not repeat,
Now all things round about repeat
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
And at economy was great;
Alone amid possessions great,
And cry: he was a poet great!
On this artistical retreat
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
When in the studyâ€™s calm retreat,
A ball here, there a childrenâ€™s treat,
Till out of breath upon a seat
Happy who quit lifeâ€™s banquet seat
Abandoned he his country seat,
Removed her to his country seat,
Begins to talk of this and that,
â€œNo misery I see in thatâ€â€”
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
Upon my lake I love to float,
But when two minutes she had sat,
My friend, â€™tis but to pay a debt,
Her brow she did not eâ€™en contract
And blush to own himself reflect.
Of keen sarcastic intellect
With so much warmth and intellect?
Two verses he could recollect
Where I can no more recollect?â€”
The perfidies I recollect
Should make me much more circumspect,
So prudent, and so circumspect
The glass unwittingly inspect
Such am I. This did ye expect,
And Christian folk will, I expect,
An inn at every stage erect.
The disenchanted glass direct
Of the Ã†neid, but incorrect.
So full of piety, correct,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
Eugene fell prostrate at her feetâ€”
Eugene fell prostrate at her feetâ€”
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Young ladiesâ€™ faces and their feet.
Are oft deceptiveâ€”like their feet.
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
But nowâ€”what brings you to my feet?â€”
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
The miserable bard to meet,
And watch her eyeâ€™s full glance to meet.
Where fashionable circles meet
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Her with a smile old women greet,
Near Kharitonâ€™s in a side street
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
That heart with inspiration sweet
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
â€œTo whom is it to go, my sweet?
â€œLook quickly to your left, my sweet!â€
Wherein I castigation get;
But time flies and she doth forget
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Beside a nameless rivulet,
And by that shady rivulet
Without enthusiasm he met
When in her walks abroad she met
Where God alone knows whom she met.
The hour whenâ€”Fate so willedâ€”we met
The hour whenâ€”Fate so willedâ€”we met
Then in the silent cabinet
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
My friends, the poet ye regret!
The fair, nor parted with regret,
Ere the bright messenger had set.
It will be by a mob beset
A simple tombstone hath been set.
On whom a sisterâ€™s heart was set
Of every sort and every set!â€â€”
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
For twice you came to them and yet
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Where in the country Eugene yet,
â€™Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
OnÃ©guine, hast forgotten yet
OnÃ©guine, hast forgotten yet
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
â€œAlas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
â€œThen amongst strangers I was leftâ€”
Of consolation all bereftâ€”
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,
And by the world repeated oft,
Born of a babbler in a loft
Raises within my breast as oft
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
But from the Musesâ€™ loftiest height
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
And hurried home his awful freight.
China and bronze the tables weight,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Above the yawning grave would fight,â€”
To many a noisy feast and fight,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
â€œI with my friend intend to fight!â€
Our hero stops and doth alight,
All about Olgaâ€”to a light
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
The crowd and merriment and light,
In my young days of wild delight
Eâ€™en for an instant find delight,
â€œBut death from him will be delight.
The curse of commonplace delight.
His spirit sank with strange delight.
Abandoning insane delight,
_Who in thy love finds more delight
To find in gossip such delight,
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
In such an album with delight
They will receive us with delight.â€
A sense of social delight,
And with emotional delight
He finally lost all delight
And bless mankind with full delight.
His ardent soul with full delight.
And solitude and calm delight,
And solitude and calm delight.
The votary of vain delight
Contemplativeness, her delight,
And like the prisonerâ€™s our delight
My pen no longer finds delight,
I love its furious delight,
And full of innocent delight,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
When tea was brought. â€™Tis my delight
Blest be the labours of the light,
As a babeâ€™s slumber, or the light
Or but for fame he saw the light;
And Schiller read by candlelight.
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
An ever transcendental flight;
There came a sudden flash of light,
Auroraâ€™s ruddy rays of lightâ€”
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Having remarked Vladimirâ€™s flight,
And swifter than the swallowâ€™s flight.
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Was withered ere the morning lightâ€”
And showed with an uncertain light
His care unto his pistolsâ€™ plight,
By liberties or loose or light.
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Arising with the morningâ€™s light,
That the two friends with morningâ€™s light
But lo! already the moonâ€™s light
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
Could not eclipse her neighbourâ€™s light.
The firmament in mellow light,
Was younger than myself, my light,
Yet clearer shines than every light
The ladiesâ€™ dresses airy, light,
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
The china teapot too ye might
If in the scenes of home I might
And be as happyâ€”as I might.
Time was, a valiant general might
Resounding through all ages might
Lay languishing both day and nightâ€”
Terror of guardians of the night;
And blest the shadows of the night.
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
Outside descend the mists of night.
From her half-open vest of night.
The moon, the stars, and shining nightâ€”
Full many a lovely star hath night
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
And glasses unemployed all night;
The altar flame was quenched in night.
So there will be a dance to-night.
But turning morning into night,
How oft, when on a summer night
My morning birdie, yesternight
â€œDelighted.â€â€”â€œWhen?â€â€”â€œThis very night.
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
And better, if I judge aright;
And better, if I judge aright;
All this, my friends, translate aright:
Seductive, animated, bright,
His ditties were as pure and bright
And is it true her garland bright
The motley moving mass and bright,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
â€™Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
When I yon semicircle bright
The goblet still is bubbling brightâ€”
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Adorned with many a vision bright
In winter on the fender bright,
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
Oâ€™erspread with Winterâ€™s carpet bright,
To youthful Olgaâ€™s beauty bright,
And form a network left and right;
I was half silly with affright.
And never was the ear affright
Other and colder thoughts affright,
In the first place, say, am I right?
Paris and Menelaus right.
Before whose inexperienced sight
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
As yet none had discovered aught;
I am not worthy them in aught;
If they were similar in aught.
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
Its passions and its modes of thought.
As on the rapid wings of thought
Because in singleness of thought
â€™Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Full of exasperating thought.
A register of fleeting thought,
â€™Tis noisome to her there: in thought
Immersed in melancholy thought,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Eugene of course related nought,
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
She hears of conversation nought
The languid mind could smile at nought,
In Taniaâ€™s praise in pouch he brought,
And my dark soul to light was brought;
A table to the fire is brought,
But trusted the ideal she wrought?â€”
At first such contradictions wrought
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
My memory wandered wide and sought
Again her rural life she sought,
The early days of life we sought.
From storms protection having sought,
Though by an error and unsoughtâ€”
The â€œin memoriamâ€ pages sought,
With measured step and even gait
All Nature winter seemed to await,
On guests their servants used to wait
But now ridiculous a bit.
Must take a walk and rest a bitâ€”
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Though we will not acknowledge it.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
For maidenâ€™s hearing deemed unfit),
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
Some day Iâ€™ll somehow finish it.
On winters of the south a skit,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
The table with its lamp unlit,
OnÃ©guine could not now submit,
He somewhat blushing would omit:
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
This he believed: a kindred spirit
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
The master always used to sit.
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruitâ€”
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
The beldam saith: â€œThe hearth, by it
The snow upon the streets doth meltâ€”
Whither along them doth he pelt?
Eâ€™en as the poet says he leant.
A letter for her hero meant:
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
On fresh allurements they are bent,
And oâ€™er the granite coping bent,
The needle nor, oâ€™er framework bent,
His butting horns in anger bent,
In the unmoved, magnificent
Like a full moon magnificent.
Now talkative, now reticent;
Who would the maiden innocent
Of affectation innocent,
Because she was so innocent,
Near young Tattiana resident,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Haughty appear, subservient,
That Heaven her character had blent
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Neâ€™er touched her fingers indolent
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Bringing his partner corpulent
Iâ€™ll pass beneath the firmament,
Shines in the female firmament
With scandalâ€™s trivial ornament.
And pleasureâ€™s daily blandishment,
A timid love to banishment?â€”
Awakens secret merriment
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
The limits of enlightenment
Calm and without embarrassment,
Having this mournful document
But nowâ€”none heeds the monument
With epigrams impertinent,
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Wherein a space OnÃ©guine spent.
Since leisure was together spent,
A while ago the winter spent,
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
Obsequious or indifferent!
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Now it is ready to be sentâ€”
â€œYou have a letter to me sent.
Their heroes used to represent
Time-honoured Kremlinâ€™s keys present.
Being from hell or heaven sent,
To a surrender gave consent,
No answer! He another sent.
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
But enough! Now, â€™tis my intent
And with his lot in life content,
But was our friend Eugene content,
First reconciled and then content;
And scanned in silence its content.
So Tania to her heartâ€™s content
In course of time (the whole extent
Time was, in style magniloquent
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Into the lonely house she went,
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
â€™Tis time she to the altar went!
Not so! My Moscow never went
And all the three to breakfast went;
OnÃ©guine to the window went
The LÃ rinas unwisely went,
The poor girl fell into a faint,
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
Imploring looks and mute complaint
Imploring looks and mute complaint
An invalid from lung complaint.
But strength of mind and self-restraint
Long since I held thee at the fontâ€”
A forest now she sees in front
In spite of common sense weâ€™re wont
And I to give thee cakes was wont?â€â€”
And in the final tome we learnt,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
Ourselves as unities to count;
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
And consolation soon begot.
To labour in his sledge forgot,
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Then, the far capital forgot,
What once I knew is clean forgotâ€”
OnÃ©guine lightning glances shot;
Philanthropist or patriot,
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
â€œBehold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Inseparable from our lot;
My country and an exileâ€™s lot;
Spite of herself with Lenskiâ€™s lot
Alas! how wretched now my lot!â€
To Russ indigenous are not;
Just at this moment I cannot.
One momentâ€™s slumber suffer not.
Keep your accounts! Youâ€™d rather not?
Into the district then to boot
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Examine her from head to foot.
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
And meditative from the spot
Was a delightful little spot,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Just manages a feeble trot
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Into the chamber where he slept
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Thee but a little space bewept,
By neighbouring families bewept,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Because her passion wanted art,
Wherein I felt loveâ€™s fatal dart,
Rekindled in my withered heart
But the young unpolluted heart
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
And ease the tortures of the heartâ€”
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
A maidenâ€™s secretsâ€”of the heart.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?â€”
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Confessions which a trusting heart
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
The indignation of her heart!
And the lone secret of her heart,
A lancer captivates her heart!
Method was dear unto his heart
The fashionable rhymesterâ€™s heart!
Within her; she is sick at heart;
Wherein I buried left my heart.
But followed the strict rules of art,
The fires of passion and its smartâ€”
But Fortune cast our lots apart
Then touching Olga they depart
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
A hidden meaning could impart,
And oft in whispers would impart
May well in innocence impart.
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Their voices nought to her impart
Poetic transport. They impart
Her passionâ€™s faithful counterpart,
How well he played the greenhornâ€™s part
How soon he learnt deceptionâ€™s art,
By flattery and loverâ€™s artâ€”
Sometimes by pleasing flatteryâ€™s art,
Which from the devilâ€™s bookcase start,
Anew the flames of passion start
Eugene designed with me to start
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
His own antagonists expert,
And, by the way, I here assert
As oft to meat and drink advert,
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
To accompany him and to escort
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
An infant maiden doth exhort
And no ridiculous report,
A box of terrible import.
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
When the obedient doll in sport
Like a Bacchante in her sport
At times to silence would resort,
With pungent or obtuse retort,
There is no fishmarket retort
Vociferously paid her court,
But, howsoeâ€™er his lot were cast,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
As if it were some funeral feast.
That youthful heartâ€”â€œBut, now at least,
He was beloved: or say at least,
Ah! Iâ€™m so weakâ€”my throbbing breast!
Had not yet withered his young breast.
Deep in our mother Earthâ€™s chill breast!â€
Bard of the â€œFeasts,â€ and mournful breast,
For every loyal Russian breast!
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She buries deep within her breast
â€œI weep. And if within your breast
â€œI weep. And if within your breast
Which rankled in Tattianaâ€™s breast,
Despite the anguish of his breast,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
â€™Twas she who first within his breast
And about dawn upon his breast
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
I by the button-hole seize fast
Poetical enthusiast,
Which might for many ages last.
Must eâ€™en despise his kind at last;
The fatal hour had come at lastâ€”
She found herself alone at last,
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Appeared, Donâ€™s effervescing boast,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Or, after dinnerâ€™s dull repast,
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
A flimsy trace of musings past
The laws of generations past,
From shades of the relentless past.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
The gulf between them was so vast,
But this is my advice, â€™twere best
In Russ her love made manifest,
Is once again made manifest.
Is once again made manifest.
A new world was made manifest!
No sense was ever manifest
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
To treat the matter as a jest,
And is it true and not a jest,
Heart would not throb albeit in jestâ€”
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
The credulous indeed are blest,
Just so! that modest swain is blest
A life in common with the rest;
Like you and me and all the rest?â€”
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Let us go seek a little restâ€”
Ye feel but little interest,
Now with what eager interest
Having once fixed your interest,
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
The body they consigned to rest,
And grant his weary bones their rest
His weary head declined at rest,
A beauty languidly at rest,
â€œNurse, â€™tis so close I cannot rest.
By fond illusions once possest
By fond illusions once possest
(This joking I used to protest),
And then made merry pope and guest,
But first permission did request
With this immoderate request
Their idols they were wont to invest
With what avidity and zest
Devoured them with an eager zest.
And soâ€”God bless them, if He list.
Am I to go through the whole list?â€
Unto the sounding sea to list,
She led me through nocturnal mist
Their own productions, some insist
So many neighbours here existâ€”
They may forget that we exist.
No greater pleasure can exist
From apprehension of the cost,
Satan will jest, and at loveâ€™s cost.
That every morn at Verreyâ€™s cost
Whither departed is the host?
God knows! The very trace is lost.
When in as instant she is lost,â€”
By their own horses, not the postâ€”
Romances pleased her from the first,
For treachery had done its worst;
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
To light had brought them from their dust,
Oâ€™er all a sheet of silvery dust
Who words and actions will adjust
For, from the outset, â€™twas unjust
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
All the young people round about,
See, I can hardly crawl aboutâ€”
But you must both be quite tired out!
Can we not stealthily make out
At forty suffered from the gout,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Within resounded shriek and shout:
Their claims and explanations shout.
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Lenski his pencil-case took out
A little Juvenal to spout,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
Of creditors a hungry rout
His comedies, a noisy rout,
â€œMy chum lives here,â€ Bruin grunts out.
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
The wind rose instantly, blew out
On lines invisible are fixt;
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
To the young girl he said adieu,
But praised be God! in health art thou!
The God of Love is after you!
Demands that I translate for you
But with austerity!â€”for you
But with austerity!â€”for you
â€œBut, _mÃ¡tushka_, to Moscow you
And now upon the snow in thaw
The time when Melancholyâ€™s claw
Obedient then to Natureâ€™s law,
He offers her his murderous paw;
I have known beauties cold and raw
A young man motionless he saw,
When in that company she saw
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
He in imagination saw
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
The woods, still naked to the view,
Because he yawned at the bare view
Russiaâ€™s Terpsichore review
I still a complication view,
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
She never more his face may view,
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
(Though certainly mankind he knew
But upon all that Eugene knew
My little book. With thee I knew
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
The triumph of a conquest new.
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
As in a garden when I grew,
And by degrees upon him grew
And soon imagination threw
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
To look on life as on a show,
Villages in the distance show
What languor would his silence show,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Unto a carping world must showâ€”
Nearest and dearest knew not how
He back as from a sudden blow?â€”
Morningâ€™s forerunners, breezes blow
They are all natural and low,
A feeble version read below,
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Gazing upon a note below.
Gazing upon a note below.
All the creations which below
To end with him her path below.
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
With its exhilarating flow,
From happy inspiration flow,
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Where plentifully feelings flow
They sat, but conversationâ€™s flow
How full of fire his speech would glow!
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
And herds of oxen wandering low;
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
To the youth Eugene hurried nowâ€”
Society he duped enow.â€
The unaffected traits she now
â€œI am in love, nurse! leave me now.â€
Then they came easily enow,
Its insignificance I know
No obstacle of which I know.
â€œSo thou art wed! I did not know.
And in the morning doth not know
â€œInform me, prince, pray dost thou know
â€œTania, my eldest child, you knowâ€â€”
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
And where may be her sister now?
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Her handkerchief she loses now;
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
And roofs near morn blanched oâ€™er with snow;
Till January fell no snowâ€”
But such is not my project now,
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
Cocked hat and melancholy brow.
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
The horizon luminous doth grow,
Nought but of dinners a long row,
How charming Olgaâ€™s shoulders grow!
And all your love on self bestow;
And linen on him doth bestow.
â€™Tis a scene of romance, I vow!â€
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Flew to collect his rural tax;
The bee forth from his cell of wax
We glide along a floor of wax.
In this the love of the fair sex
In love, although its tempests vex,
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
And also fashionable beaux.
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
And past the threshold of decay,
Chained to his bedside night and day
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
What, invitations? The same day
Beside the stormy sea one day
Unto their solitude one day,
And in reality one day
Impatient waits the close of day,
To anticipate the break of day,
To-morrow before break of day,
Listless is she the livelong day
He sat, and then the livelong day,
In cruel solitude each day
In haunts of fashion where each day
Jiltedâ€”glad of a holiday.
Spectacles upon nose, all day
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
Yet on a frosty winter day
To-morrow just like yesterday.
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Well! just as she was yesterday.
From Romulus unto our day.
We visit about Christmas Day,
She gazed around herâ€”it was day.
And wholly occupied his dayâ€”
Olgaâ€™s admirer came that day:
Had much to do at home that day,
As men who much had done that day.
That he was â€œready any day.â€
She was as heedless and as gayâ€”
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Till mornâ€”life uniform but gay,
And for a time our course delay,
Arrange without the least delayâ€”
The bridegroom sage without delay
â€œBring dinner now without delay!â€
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
No senseless fashionable lay
How sick to death his uncle lay
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
Within his memory there lay,
â€œHow often in thine arms I lay;
Then, her distraction to allay,
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
How with thy medal I would play,
The military band will play.
A game of chess would often play,
Was wont with me at cards to play.
Cunning already to display
â€™Tis there that arrant fops display
For the young poet they display.
Lo! through the frozen windows play
To make wise men the idiot play
He would not that a man ye slay
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
In the beginning of this lay,
Unto the hero of this lay
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Enough, enough, conclude thy layâ€”
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Was drawn, ideal of my layâ€”
But the dark sepulchre I may
Some army poet therein may
That grandmothers and grandsires may
And though perchance a lady may
Or by a card our homage pay,
Another visit hastes to pay.
For follyâ€™s dues thou hadst to pay.
Let us congratulations pay
To see his Olga ere the frayâ€”
Curtly announcing for the fray
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
â€œTo-morrowâ€™s dawn will glimmer gray,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
â€œâ€™Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
â€œWho? Is it that stout general, pray?â€â€”
Avowal then â€™twas time to pray,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Here bottles stand in close array,
His intellect in close array.
Behind, of glasses an array,
But I abandoned their array,
The trees in silvery array,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
And well-instructed to betray!
All with urbanity betray,
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Minutely I will now portray.
Tattiana purchased with a stray
So frequently his mind would stray
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
And thus unto her nurse did say:
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
And starting suddenly doth say:
Almost became a poet sayâ€”
â€œTell me, why doth your comrade stay?â€
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
Transfixed OnÃ©guine mine doth stay.
He cared no longer there to stay,
Horror! had she not better stay
But it grew late; he must not stay;
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
Nor did her blushes fade away,
The starry beacons fade away,
Carried a truth divine away;
OnÃ©guine Olga bore away.
How oft the kindly Muse away
And gallops to her house away.
As it were, tore himself away.
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
From the dread pistol turn away.
Without a chance to slip away.
The mystic lines to tear away
Deep in the greenwood far away?
And to OnÃ©guine far away
But thoughts meander far awayâ€”
Lost in the hamlet far away.
But borne in spirit far away
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
But Summer swiftly fades away
I write, and anguish flies away,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
It whiled his idle hours away
The lilyâ€™s stem to eat away,
Unto her husband, went awayâ€”
With serious air then went away
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Take to their wings and fly away.
There jars of cider block the way,
His furs are powdered on the way
In a lax or informal way,
He still made love in a queer way;
Unto the fields she makes her way,
Ah! he has gone the other wayâ€â€”
â€œOh! whither have ye winged your way,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
Impetuously clove its way
Ivan PetrÃ²vitch still a gaby,
Simeon PetrÃ²vitch just as shabby;
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
OnÃ©guine sat the table by
But I was sharp in times gone by.
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
No trace ye left in passing by
At table she was sitting by
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
And like a palisade flit by.
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
Nor by her sisterâ€™s brilliancy
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Tania, observed by nobody,
And (elbows on the table) they
To consanguineous dinners they
More crimson every moment they.
To idle musing was a prey;
A loverâ€™s letter might convey,
Eventually petrify
May find a crumb to satisfy.
He neâ€™er shall hear Timeâ€™s eulogy,
Possess my love and sympathy.
The witching light of sympathy;
At least by show of sympathy;
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
I cannot tell the reason why,
She fears she cannot.â€”Cannot? Why?â€”
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
When on the pallid eastern sky
The nights of golden Italy
Presents her quarto amiably,
But Eugene, incontestably,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Upon his couch insensibly;
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
And now we hear delightedly
What agitation languidly
But not at present, though sincerely
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
And turned to leave immediately,
â€œNo matter, look immediately.
Took aimâ€”but as immediately
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
Or innocently past me fly.
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The evanescent fashions fly
Unto the gates the servants fly
Alas! lifeâ€™s hours which swiftly fly
I like this word exceedingly
And the world met her smilingly,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
â€œWho will be there?â€â€”â€œThe family.
What say you? to the familyâ€”
And like Childe Harold gloomily
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
And the far mountains daintily
Terror assails her. Hastily
So from the mountain lazily
God save his soul eternally
With him were friends eternally:
But of this love, eâ€™en casually,
To all she answers cruellyâ€”
By waters shining tranquilly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Descried before me suddenly!
Have my OnÃ©guineâ€”suddenly.
Have my OnÃ©guineâ€”suddenly.
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
His transports were quite maidenly,
â€œWhat! Grandison?â€â€”â€œYes, certainly!â€
The reaping girls approach and ply
Prevailed at last. She in reply
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
Though Iâ€™ll return to him right early,
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
From habit or maliciously,
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Or into bold hands anxiously
Youâ€™ll spend your winter famously!
In the French language perfectly,
Known unto children perfectly:
â€œThen send your grandson quietly
Tattiana suffered secretly;
Then heâ€™d malign them secretly
To lay two covers secretly.
Turned to her and discordantly
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Oh! I accept. And instantly
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
The same warm vision constantly;
Employ your glasses constantly,
She cannotâ€”then impatiently
He drops his pistol silently.
With clouded brow stands silently?
Around her neck, now violently
â€œAnd heâ€”but of him presentlyâ€”
And of the attic. Honestly,
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Having performed his service truly,
He brought from mystic Germany
The captain of a company.
But who in that choice company
There, in that knot of company,
Wallow, my friends, in company!
The man and liked his company,
I thank thee. In thy company,
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
There is no stupid calumny
She loved upon the balcony
Hath whiled the roadâ€™s monotony,
It occupied him from a boy,
Into the study of the boy
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Which in the winter were a joy:
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
In idleness and tranquil joy
Sang childhoodâ€™s pastimes and its joy,
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
The happiest days of life employ?
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
The feeble moment would espy
And following them ye might espy
Must now my stanzas occupy.
But more the passions occupy
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Light sallies without coxcombry,
She strains her throat to force a cryâ€”
Dark shadows thickenâ€”a dread cry
And wakened him with the loud cry:
Heedless of your despairing cry?
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
But my Tattianaâ€™s eyes were dry.
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Upon the windows tracery,
By night prepared for sorcery,
But scarce had sleepâ€™s soft witchery
And turned aside the drapery;
The clue unto some mystery
To be a charming mystery:
With ardent sighs and flattery
Alike by sighs and flattery.
(Like love, another sort of knavery!)
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
But, her own room in memory,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Relate some ancient history.â€
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Free, I renewed the idolatry
That Ninaâ€™s marble symmetry,
Fragments of northern poetry,
And platitudes and pedantry,
He feared the criminal might try
Will pass; the same to-morrow tryâ€”
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Byronâ€™s capricious phantasy
Carried away by ecstasy,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Must bow in common courtesy;
Is full of frigid jealousy,
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
By the sick ladyâ€™s gaiety
Lead into good society,
Lest jaded with satiety,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
But man of sense and probity.
Upon its damp opacity,
Before such fond simplicity
Charming with grave simplicity.
And mental elasticity.
Of Russian domesticity;
Cursing his own stupidity,
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
Discovered much absurdity,
By dull insensibility,
And then with blind credulity
And husbandsâ€™ tedious amity?
But grant with magnanimity
And naked uniformity.
The blessings of humanity.
Like him renouncing vanity,
By his embarrassed dignityâ€”
Of old maids the divinity,
I will with thy divinity
Passed into dull eternity,
Have echoed to eternity.
Hears not my importunity!
As giddy youthâ€™s hilarityâ€”
Charming is your sincerity,
As Winter in their purity,
Dreams with no continuity,
The style of wise antiquity.
It carries of antiquity
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
With hope and then perplexity,
With us â€™tis quite a novelty
The child of sloth and liberty.
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Idolatry of liberty,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Of tender years the modesty

______________________________________NORMAL ONEGIN___________________________________

ï»¿â€œMy uncleâ€™s goodness is extreme,
If seriously he hath disease;
He hath acquired the worldâ€™s esteem
And nothing more important sees;
A paragon of virtue he!
But what a nuisance it will be,
Chained to his bedside night and day
Without a chance to slip away.
Ye need dissimulation base
A dying man with art to soothe,
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
And physic bring with mournful face,
To sigh and meditate alone:
When will the devil take his own!â€

Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
Inheritor of all his race.
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
Let me present ye to the man,
Who without more prevarication
The hero is of my narration!
OnÃ©guine, O my gentle readers,
Was born beside the Neva, where
It may be ye were born, or there
Have shone as one of fashionâ€™s leaders.
I also wandered there of old,
But cannot stand the northern cold.

Having performed his service truly,
Deep into debt his father ran;
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
At last became a ruined man.
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
For first â€œmadameâ€ his wants observed,
And then â€œmonsieurâ€ supplied her place;
The boy was wild but full of grace.
â€œMonsieur lâ€™AbbÃ©â€ a starving Gaul,
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Morality taught scarce at all;
Gently for pranks he would reprove
And in the Summer Garden rove.

When youthâ€™s rebellious hour drew near
And my Eugene the path must traceâ€”
The path of hope and tender fearâ€”
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
Lo! my OnÃ©guine free as air,
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
Dressed like a London dandy he
The giddy world at last shall see.
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
In the French language perfectly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
What moreâ€™s required? The world replies,
He is a charming youth and wise.

We all of us of education
A something somehow have obtained,
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
With us is easily attained.
OnÃ©guine wasâ€”so many deemed
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Pedantic although scholar like,
In truth he had the happy trick
Without constraint in conversation
Of touching lightly every theme.
Silent, oracular yeâ€™d see him
Amid a serious disputation,
Then suddenly discharge a joke
The ladiesâ€™ laughter to provoke.

Latin is just now not in vogue,
But if the truth I must relate,
OnÃ©guine knew enough, the rogue
A mild quotation to translate,
A little Juvenal to spout,
With â€œvaleâ€ finish off a note;
Two verses he could recollect
Of the Ã†neid, but incorrect.
In history he took no pleasure,
The dusty chronicles of earth
For him were but of little worth,
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
Within his memory there lay,
From Romulus unto our day.

For empty sound the rascal swore he
Existence would not make a curse,
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
And at economy was great;
That is, he could elucidate
How empires store of wealth unfold,
How flourish, why and wherefore less
If the raw product they possess
The medium is required of gold.
The father scarcely understands
His son and mortgages his lands.

But upon all that Eugene knew
I have no leisure here to dwell,
But say he was a genius who
In one thing really did excel.
It occupied him from a boy,
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
It whiled his idle hours away
And wholly occupied his dayâ€”
The amatory science warm,
Which Ovid once immortalized,
For which the poet agonized
Laid down his life of sun and storm
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
Far from his Italyâ€”his own.

How soon he learnt deceptionâ€™s art,
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
Haughty appear, subservient,
Obsequious or indifferent!
What languor would his silence show,
How full of fire his speech would glow!
How artless was the note which spoke
Of love again, and yet again;
How deftly could he transport feign!
How bright and tender was his look,
Modest yet daring! And a tear
Would at the proper time appear.

How well he played the greenhornâ€™s part
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
Sometimes by pleasing flatteryâ€™s art,
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
The feeble moment would espy
Of tender years the modesty
Conquer by passion and address,
Await the long-delayed caress.
Avowal then â€™twas time to pray,
Attentive to the heartâ€™s first beating,
Follow up loveâ€”a secret meeting
Arrange without the least delayâ€”
Then, thenâ€”well, in some solitude
Lessons to give he understood!

How soon he learnt to titillate
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
Desirous to annihilate
His own antagonists expert,
How bitterly he would malign,
With many a snare their pathway line!
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
With him were friends eternally:
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
And the suspicious veteran old,
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
Who floats contentedly through life,
Proud of his dinners and his wife!

One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
His valet brings him letters three.
What, invitations? The same day
As many entertainments be!
A ball here, there a childrenâ€™s treat,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
Whither shall he go first? Heâ€™ll see,
Perchance he will to all the three.
Meantime in matutinal dress
And hat surnamed a â€œBolivarâ€
He hies unto the â€œBoulevard,â€
To loiter there in idleness
Until the sleepless BrÃ©guet chime
Announcing to him dinner-time.

â€™Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
â€œDrive on!â€ the cheerful cry goes forth,
His furs are powdered on the way
By the fine silver of the north.
He bends his course to Talonâ€™s, where
He knows Kaverine will repair.
He enters. High the cork arose
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
Before him red roast beef is seen
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
And Limburg cheese alive and old
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.

Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
To cool the cutletsâ€™ seething grease,
When the sonorous BrÃ©guet tells
Of the commencement of the piece.
A critic of the stage malicious,
A slave of actresses capricious,
OnÃ©guine was a citizen
Of the domains of the side-scene.
To the theatre he repairs
Where each young critic ready stands,
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
Moina recalls for this alone
That all may hear his voiceâ€™s tone.

Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
Shone pungent Satireâ€™s dauntless king,
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
The young Simeonova too there
With Ozeroff was wont to share
Applause, the peopleâ€™s donative.
There our KatÃ¨nine did revive
Corneilleâ€™s majestic genius,
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
His comedies, a noisy rout,
There Didelot became glorious,
There, there, beneath the side-sceneâ€™s shade
The drama of my youth was played.

My goddesses, where are your shades?
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Are ye replaced by other maids
Who cannot conjure former joys?
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Russiaâ€™s Terpsichore review
Again in her ethereal dance?
Or will my melancholy glance
On the dull stage find all things changed,
The disenchanted glass direct
Where I can no more recollect?â€”
A careless looker-on estranged
In silence shall I sit and yawn
And dream of lifeâ€™s delightful dawn?

The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
The curtain now they slowly raise.
Obedient to the magic strings,
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
Istomina(*) the nimbly-bounding;
With one foot resting on its tip
Slow circling round its fellow swings
And now she skips and now she springs
Like down from Aeolusâ€™s lip,
Now her lithe form she arches oâ€™er
And beats with rapid foot the floor.

Shouts of applause! OnÃ©guine passes
Between the stalls, along the toes;
Seated, a curious look with glasses
On unknown female forms he throws.
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Reviews both dress and countenance,
With all dissatisfaction shows.
To male acquaintances he bows,
And finally he deigns let fall
Upon the stage his weary glance.
He yawns, averts his countenance,
Exclaiming, â€œWe must change â€™em all!
I long by ballets have been bored,
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!â€

Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Across the stage still madly sweep,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Still everywhere, without, within,
The lamps illuminating shine;
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
And of the irksome harness tires,
And still the coachmen round the fires
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
But Eugene long hath left the press
To array himself in evening dress.

Faithfully shall I now depict,
Portray the solitary den
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
All that industrial London brings
For tallow, wood and other things
Across the Balticâ€™s salt sea waves,
All which caprice and affluence craves,
All which in Paris eager taste,
Choosing a profitable trade,
For our amusement ever made
And ease and fashionable waste,â€”
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Philosopher just turned eighteen.

China and bronze the tables weight,
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
And, joy of souls effeminate,
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
Dared calmly cleanse his nails â€™fore him,
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,â€”
The friend of liberty and laws
In this case quite mistaken was.

The most industrious man alive
May yet be studious of his nails;
What boots it with the age to strive?
Custom the despot soon prevails.
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
Dreading the worldâ€™s remarks malign,
Was that which we are wont to call
A fop, in dress pedantical.
Three mortal hours per diem he
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And from his dressing-room would pass
Like Venus when, capriciously,
The goddess would a masquerade
Attend in male attire arrayed.

On this artistical retreat
Having once fixed your interest,
I might to connoisseurs repeat
The style in which my hero dressed;
Though I confess I hardly dare
Describe in detail the affair,
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
To Russ indigenous are not;
And also that my feeble verseâ€”
Pardon I ask for such a sinâ€”
With words of foreign origin
Too much Iâ€™m given to intersperse,
Though to the Academy I come
And oft its Dictionary thumb.

But such is not my project now,
So let us to the ball-room haste,
Whither at headlong speed doth go
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
Past darkened windows and long streets
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Which shines with iridescent hues.
He nears a spacious mansionâ€™s gate,
By many a lamp illuminate,
And through the lofty windows views
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
And also fashionable beaux.

Our hero stops and doth alight,
Flies past the porter to the stair,
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
No more the music thunders loud,
Some a mazurka occupies,
Crushing and a confusing noise;
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
And following them ye might espy
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
And by the fiddleâ€™s rushing sound
The voice of jealousy is drowned.

In my young days of wild delight
On balls I madly used to dote,
Fond declarations they invite
Or the delivery of a note.
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
I would your vigilance arouse,
Attentive be unto my rhymes
And due precautions take betimes.
Ye mothers also, caution use,
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
Employ your glasses constantly,
For otherwiseâ€”God only knows!
I lift a warning voice because
I long have ceased to offend the laws.

Alas! lifeâ€™s hours which swiftly fly
Iâ€™ve wasted in amusements vain,
But were it not immoral I
Should dearly like a dance again.
I love its furious delight,
The crowd and merriment and light,
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
Also their feetâ€”yet neâ€™ertheless
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
Ah! I still struggle to forget
A pair; though desolate my mind,
Their memory lingers still and seems
To agitate me in my dreams.

When, where, and in what desert land,
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
No trace ye left in passing by
Upon the dreary northern snows,
But better loved the soft repose
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
I once forgot for your sweet cause
The thirst for fame and manâ€™s applause,
My country and an exileâ€™s lot;
My joy in youth was fleeting eâ€™en
As your light footprints on the green.

Dianaâ€™s bosom, Floraâ€™s cheeks,
Are admirable, my dear friend,
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
Charms more enduring in the end.
For promises her feet reveal
Of untold gain she must conceal,
Their privileged allurements fire
A hidden train of wild desire.
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
In winter on the fender bright,
In springtime on the meadows green,
Upon the ball-roomâ€™s glassy floor
Or by the oceanâ€™s rocky shore.

Beside the stormy sea one day
I envied sore the billows tall,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
How like the billow I desired
To kiss the feet which I admired!
No, never in the early blaze
Of fiery youthâ€™s untutored days
So ardently did I desire
A young Armidaâ€™s lips to press,
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
Or bosom full of languid fire,â€”
A gust of passion never tore
My spirit with such pangs before.

Another time, so willed it Fate,
Immersed in secret thought I stand
And grasp a stirrup fortunateâ€”
Her foot was in my other hand.
Again imagination blazed,
The contact of the foot I raised
Rekindled in my withered heart
The fires of passion and its smartâ€”
Away! and cease to ring their praise
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
The proud ones are not worth the fire
Of passion they so often raise.
The words and looks of charmers sweet
Are oft deceptiveâ€”like their feet.

Where is OnÃ©guine? Half asleep,
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
The drum already doth arouse.
The shopman and the pedlar rise
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
The shutters open; to the skies
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
The German baker looks around
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
And pauses oft to serve out bread.

But turning morning into night,
Tired by the ballâ€™s incessant noise,
The votary of vain delight
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Late in the afternoon to rise,
When the same life before him lies
Till mornâ€”life uniform but gay,
To-morrow just like yesterday.
But was our friend Eugene content,
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
Amidst successes flattering
And pleasureâ€™s daily blandishment,
Or vainly â€™mid luxurious fare
Was he in health and void of care?â€”

Even so! His passions soon abated,
Hateful the hollow world became,
Nor long his mind was agitated
By loveâ€™s inevitable flame.
For treachery had done its worst;
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Because he could not gourmandise
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
And irrigate them with champagne;
Nor slander viciously could spread
Wheneâ€™er he had an aching head;
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
He finally lost all delight
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.

His malady, whose cause I ween
It now to investigate is time,
Was nothing but the British spleen
Transported to our Russian clime.
It gradually possessed his mind;
Though, God be praised! he neâ€™er designed
To slay himself with blade or ball,
Indifferent he became to all,
And like Childe Harold gloomily
He to the festival repairs,
Nor boston nor the worldâ€™s affairs
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Impressed him in the least degree,â€”
Callous to all he seemed to be.

Ye miracles of courtly grace,
He left _you_ first, and I must own
The manners of the highest class
Have latterly vexatious grown;
And though perchance a lady may
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
Yet as a rule their talk I call
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
Then theyâ€™re so innocent of vice,
So full of piety, correct,
So prudent, and so circumspect
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
So inaccessible to men,
Their looks alone produce the spleen.

And you, my youthful damsels fair,
Whom latterly one often meets
Urging your droshkies swift as air
Along Saint Petersburgâ€™s paved streets,
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Abandoning insane delight,
And isolated from all men,
Yawning betook him to a pen.
He thought to write, but labour long
Inspired him with disgust and so
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
And thus he never fell among
That vicious set whom I donâ€™t blameâ€”
Because a member I became.

Once more to idleness consigned,
He felt the laudable desire
From mere vacuity of mind
The wit of others to acquire.
A case of books he doth obtainâ€”
He reads at random, reads in vain.
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
All are constrained and fetters bear,
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
The moderns of the ancients raveâ€”
Books he abandoned like the fair,
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
With taffety instead of crape.

Having abjured the haunts of men,
Like him renouncing vanity,
His friendship I acquired just then;
His character attracted me.
An innate love of meditation,
Original imagination,
And cool sagacious mind he had:
I was incensed and he was sad.
Both were of passion satiate
And both of dull existence tired,
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
Both were expectant of the hate
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
The very morning of our days.

He who hath lived and living, thinks,
Must eâ€™en despise his kind at last;
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
From shades of the relentless past.
No fond illusions live to soothe,
But memory like a serpentâ€™s tooth
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
All this in many cases brings
A charm with it in conversation.
OnÃ©guineâ€™s speeches I abhorred
At first, but soon became inured
To the sarcastic observation,
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
And gloomy epigrams malicious.

How oft, when on a summer night
Transparent oâ€™er the Neva beamed
The firmament in mellow light,
And when the watery mirror gleamed
No more with pale Dianaâ€™s rays,
We called to mind our youthful daysâ€”
The days of love and of romance!
Then would we muse as in a trance,
Impressionable for an hour,
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
And like the prisonerâ€™s our delight
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
As on the rapid wings of thought
The early days of life we sought.

Absorbed in melancholy mood
And oâ€™er the granite coping bent,
OnÃ©guine meditative stood,
Eâ€™en as the poet says he leant.
â€™Tis silent all! Alone the cries
Of the night sentinels arise
And from the Millionaya afar
The sudden rattling of a car.
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
And now we hear delightedly
A jolly song and distant horn;
But sweeter in a midnight dream
Torquato Tassoâ€™s strains I deem.

Ye billows of blue Hadriaâ€™s sea,
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
And, inspiration firing me,
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Whose tones Apolloâ€™s sons inspire,
And after Albionâ€™s proud lyre
Possess my love and sympathy.
The nights of golden Italy
Iâ€™ll pass beneath the firmament,
Hid in the gondolaâ€™s dark shade,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Now talkative, now reticent;
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.

When will my hour of freedom come!
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
Awaiting on the shore I roam
And beckon to the passing sails.
Upon the highway of the sea
When shall I wing my passage free
On waves by tempests curdled oâ€™er!
â€™Tis time to quit this weary shore
So uncongenial to my mind,
To dream upon the sunny strand
Of Africa, ancestral land,
Of dreary Russia left behind,
Wherein I felt loveâ€™s fatal dart,
Wherein I buried left my heart.

Eugene designed with me to start
And visit many a foreign clime,
But Fortune cast our lots apart
For a protracted space of time.
Just at that time his father died,
And soon OnÃ©guineâ€™s door beside
Of creditors a hungry rout
Their claims and explanations shout.
But Eugene, hating litigation
And with his lot in life content,
To a surrender gave consent,
Seeing in this no deprivation,
Or counting on his uncleâ€™s death
And what the old man might bequeath.

And in reality one day
The steward sent a note to tell
How sick to death his uncle lay
And wished to say to him farewell.
Having this mournful document
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
And hastened to his uncleâ€™s side,
But in his heart dissatisfied,
Having for moneyâ€™s sake alone
Sorrow to counterfeit and wailâ€”
Thus we began our little taleâ€”
But, to his uncleâ€™s mansion flown,
He found him on the table laid,
A due which must to earth be paid.

The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
And from the country all around
Had come both friends and enemiesâ€”
Funeral amateurs abound!
The body they consigned to rest,
And then made merry pope and guest,
With serious air then went away
As men who much had done that day.
Lo! my OnÃ©guine rural lord!
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
He now a full possession takes,
He who economy abhorred,
Delighted much his former ways
To vary for a few brief days.

For two whole days it seemed a change
To wander through the meadows still,
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
To listen to the rippling rill.
But on the third of grove and mead
He took no more the slightest heed;
They made him feel inclined to doze;
And the conviction soon arose,
Ennui can in the country dwell
Though without palaces and streets,
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fÃªtes;
On him spleen mounted sentinel
And like his shadow dogged his life,
Or better,â€”like a faithful wife.

I was for calm existence made,
For rural solitude and dreams,
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
And more imagination teems.
On innocent delights I dote,
Upon my lake I love to float,
For law I _far niente_ take
And every morning I awake
The child of sloth and liberty.
I slumber much, a little read,
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
In former years thus did not I
In idleness and tranquil joy
The happiest days of life employ?

Love, flowers, the country, idleness
And fields my joys have ever been;
I like the difference to express
Between myself and my Eugene,
Lest the malicious reader or
Some one or other editor
Of keen sarcastic intellect
Herein my portrait should detect,
And impiously should declare,
To sketch myself that I have tried
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
As if impossible it were
To write of any other elf
Than oneâ€™s own fascinating self.

Here I remark all poets are
Love to idealize inclined;
I have dreamed many a vision fair
And the recesses of my mind
Retained the image, though short-lived,
Which afterwards the muse revived.
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
The captives of the Salguirâ€™s shore.
But now a question in this wise
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
To whom amongst the jealous throng
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?

Whose glance reflecting inspiration
With tenderness hath recognized
Thy meditative incantationâ€”
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
None, be my witness Heaven above!
The malady of hopeless love
I have endured without respite.
Happy who thereto can unite
Poetic transport. They impart
A double force unto their song
Who following Petrarch move along
And ease the tortures of the heartâ€”
Perchance they laurels also cullâ€”
But I, in love, was mute and dull.

The Muse appeared, when love passed by
And my dark soul to light was brought;
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Of harmony enshrining thought.
I write, and anguish flies away,
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Around my stanzas incomplete
Young ladiesâ€™ faces and their feet.
Extinguished ashes do not blazeâ€”
I mourn, but tears I cannot shedâ€”
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
Time will the ravages effaceâ€”
When that time comes, a poem Iâ€™ll strive
To write in cantos twenty-five.

Iâ€™ve thought well oâ€™er the general plan,
The heroâ€™s name too in advance,
Meantime Iâ€™ll finish whilst I can
Canto the First of this romance.
Iâ€™ve scanned it with a jealous eye,
Discovered much absurdity,
But will not modify a tittleâ€”
I owe the censorship a little.
For journalistic deglutition
I yield the fruit of work severe.
Go, on the Nevaâ€™s bank appear,
My very latest composition!
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestowsâ€”
Misunderstanding, words and blows.

The village wherein yawned Eugene
Was a delightful little spot,
There friends of pure delight had been
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
The lonely mansion-house to screen
From gales a hill behind was seen;
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Villages in the distance show
And herds of oxen wandering low;
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
A thick immense neglected grove
Extendedâ€”haunt which Dryads love.

â€™Twas built, the venerable pile,
As lordly mansions ought to be,
In solid, unpretentious style,
The style of wise antiquity.
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
Imperial portraits hang around
And stoves of various shapes abound.
All this I know is out of date,
I cannot tell the reason why,
But Eugene, incontestably,
The matter did not agitate,
Because he yawned at the bare view
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.

He took the room wherein the old
Manâ€”forty years long in this wiseâ€”
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
Look through the window and kill flies.
â€™Twas plainâ€”an oaken floor ye scan,
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
And not a speck of dirt descried.
OnÃ©guine oped the cupboards wide.
In one he doth accounts behold,
Here bottles stand in close array,
There jars of cider block the way,
An almanac but eight years old.
His uncle, busy man indeed,
No other book had time to read.

Alone amid possessions great,
Eugene at first began to dream,
If but to lighten Timeâ€™s dull rate,
Of many an economic scheme;
This anchorite amid his waste
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
By an _obrokâ€™s_ indulgent rate:
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
But this a heinous crime appeared
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Who secretly denounced the gift,
And many another slily sneered;
And all with one accord agreed,
He was a dangerous fool indeed.

All visited him at first, of course;
But since to the backdoor they led
Most usually a Cossack horse
Upon the Donâ€™s broad pastures bred
If they but heard domestic loads
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
Most by this circumstance offended
All overtures of friendship ended.
â€œOh! what a fool our neighbour is!
Heâ€™s a freemason, so we think.
Alone he doth his claret drink,
A ladyâ€™s hand doth never kiss.
â€™Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_â€
This was his social character.

Into the district then to boot
A new proprietor arrived,
From whose analysis minute
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
From Gottingen inspired he came,
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
A young and handsome galliard.
He brought from mystic Germany
The fruits of learning and combined
A fiery and eccentric mind,
Idolatry of liberty,
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.

The pervert world with icy chill
Had not yet withered his young breast.
His heart reciprocated still
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
He was a dear delightful foolâ€”
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
The riot of the world and glare
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
And by a sweet delusion he
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
He deemed of human life the goal
To be a charming mystery:
He racked his brains to find its clue
And marvels deemed he thus should view.

This he believed: a kindred spirit
Impelled to union with his own
Lay languishing both day and nightâ€”
Waiting his comingâ€”his alone!
He deemed his friends but longed to make
Great sacrifices for his sake!
That a friendâ€™s arm in every case
Felled a calumniator base!
That chosen heroes consecrate,
Friends of the sons of every land,
Existâ€”that their immortal band
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
And bless mankind with full delight.

Compassion now or wrath inspires
And now philanthropy his soul,
And now his youthful heart desires
The path which leads to gloryâ€™s goal.
His harp beneath that sky had rung
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
And at the altar of their fame
He kindled his poetic flame.
But from the Musesâ€™ loftiest height
The gifted songster never swerved,
But proudly in his song preserved
An ever transcendental flight;
His transports were quite maidenly,
Charming with grave simplicity.

He sang of loveâ€”to love a slave.
His ditties were as pure and bright
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
As a babeâ€™s slumber, or the light
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Goddess of loversâ€™ tender sighs.
He sang of separation grim,
Of what not, and of distant dim,
Of roses to romancers dear;
To foreign lands he would allude,
Where long time he in solitude
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
He sang of lifeâ€™s fresh colours stained
Before he eighteen years attained.

Since Eugene in that solitude
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
A scant attendance Lenski showed
At neighbouring hospitalities.
He shunned those parties boisterous;
The conversation tedious
About the crop of hay, the wine,
The kennel or a kindred line,
Was certainly not erudite
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
A sense of social delight,
But still more stupid did appear
The gossip of their ladies fair.

Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Lenski as a good match received,â€”
Such is the country custom good;
All mothers their sweet girls believed
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
He enters: rapidly discussion
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
The sorrows of a single state.
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
The young proprietor we find;
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
And a guitar produced we see,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
_Come to my golden palace, dear_!

But Lenski, having no desire
Vows matrimonial to break,
With our OnÃ©guine doth aspire
Acquaintance instantly to make.
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
If they were similar in aught.
At first such contradictions wrought
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
But grown familiar side by side
On horseback every day they rideâ€”
Inseparable soon they be.
Thus oftâ€”this I myself confessâ€”
Men become friends from idleness.

But even thus not now-a-days!
In spite of common sense weâ€™re wont
As cyphers others to appraise,
Ourselves as unities to count;
And like Napoleons each of us
A million bipeds reckons thus
One instrument for his own useâ€”
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
Eugene, more tolerant than this
(Though certainly mankind he knew
And usually despised it too),
Exceptionless as no rule is,
A few of different temper deemed,
Feeling in others much esteemed.

With smiling face he Lenski hears;
The poetâ€™s fervid conversation
And judgment which unsteady veers
And eye which gleams with inspirationâ€”
All this was novel to Eugene.
The cold reply with gloomy mien
He oft upon his lips would curb,
Thinking: â€™tis foolish to disturb
This evanescent boyish bliss.
Time without me will lessons give,
So meantime let him joyous live
And deem the world perfection is!
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
And youthful madness, youthful fires.

The gulf between them was so vast,
Debate commanded ample foodâ€”
The laws of generations past,
The fruits of science, evil, good,
The prejudices all men have,
The fatal secrets of the grave,
And life and fate in turn selected
Were to analysis subjected.
The fervid poet would recite,
Carried away by ecstasy,
Fragments of northern poetry,
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
Though scarcely following what was said,
Attentive listened to the lad.

But more the passions occupy
The converse of our hermits twain,
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
An exile from their troublous reign,
Eugene would speak regarding these.
Thrice happy who their agonies
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
Still happier he who neâ€™er hath known!
By absence who hath chilled his love,
His hate by slander, and who spends
Existence without wife or friends,
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
And who the rent-roll of his race
Neâ€™er trusted to the treacherous ace.

When, wise at length, we seek repose
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
When Passionâ€™s fire no longer glows
And when her violence reviewedâ€”
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Reduced with effort unto sense,
We hear with interest intense
The accents wild of otherâ€™s woes,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
So ancient warriors, battles oâ€™er,
A curious interest disclose
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Lost in the hamlet far away.

And in addition youth is flame
And cannot anything conceal,
Is ever ready to proclaim
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
In loveâ€™s campaigns OnÃ©guine heard
With quite a lachrymose expression
The youthful poetâ€™s fond confession.
He with an innocence extreme
His inner consciousness laid bare,
And Eugene soon discovered there
The story of his young loveâ€™s dream,
Where plentifully feelings flow
Which we experienced long ago.

Alas! he loved as in our times
Men love no more, as only the
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Is still condemned in love to be;
One image occupied his mind,
Constant affection intertwined
And an habitual sense of pain;
And distance interposed in vain,
Nor years of separation all
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
His constant soul could ever tire,
Which glowed with virginal desire.

When but a boy he Olga loved
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
Beneath the sheltering oak treeâ€™s shade
He with his little maiden played,
Whilst the fond parents, friends throâ€™ life,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
And full of innocent delight,
As in a thicketâ€™s humble shade,
Beneath her parentsâ€™ eyes the maid
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
By bee and butterfly which pass.

â€™Twas she who first within his breast
Poetic transport did infuse,
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
â€™Twas then he loved the tangled grove
And solitude and calm delight,
The moon, the stars, and shining nightâ€”
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
To whom we used to consecrate
A promenade in twilight late
With tears which secret sufferers loveâ€”
But now in her effulgence pale
A substitute for lamps we hail!

Obedient she had ever been
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
As a poetic life serene,
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
All about Olgaâ€”to a light
Romance of love I pray refer,
Youâ€™ll find her portrait there, I vouch;
I formerly admired her much
But finally grew bored by her.
But with her elder sister I
Must now my stanzas occupy.

Tattiana was her appellation.
We are the first who such a name
In pages of a love narration
With such a perversity proclaim.
But wherefore not?â€”â€™Tis pleasant, nice,
Euphonious, though I know a spice
It carries of antiquity
And of the attic. Honestly,
We must admit but little taste
Doth in us or our names appear
(I speak not of our poems here),
And education runs to waste,
Endowing us from out her store
With affectation,â€”nothing more.

And so Tattiana was her name,
Nor by her sisterâ€™s brilliancy
Nor by her beauty she became
The cynosure of every eye.
Shy, silent did the maid appear
As in the timid forest deer,
Even beneath her parentsâ€™ roof
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Nearest and dearest knew not how
To fawn upon and love express;
A child devoid of childishness
To romp and play she neâ€™er would go:
Oft staring through the window pane
Would she in silence long remain.

Contemplativeness, her delight,
Eâ€™en from her cradleâ€™s earliest dream,
Adorned with many a vision bright
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Neâ€™er touched her fingers indolent
The needle nor, oâ€™er framework bent,
Would she the canvas tight enrich
With gay design and silken stitch.
Desire to rule ye may observe
When the obedient doll in sport
An infant maiden doth exhort
Polite demeanour to preserve,
Gravely repeating to another
Recent instructions of its mother.

But Tania neâ€™er displayed a passion
For dolls, eâ€™en from her earliest years,
And gossip of the town and fashion
She neâ€™er repeated unto hers.
Strange unto her each childish game,
But when the winter season came
And dark and drear the evenings were,
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
All the young people round about,
At prisonerâ€™s base she never played.
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Their giddy sports she neâ€™er enjoyed.

She loved upon the balcony
To anticipate the break of day,
When on the pallid eastern sky
The starry beacons fade away,
The horizon luminous doth grow,
Morningâ€™s forerunners, breezes blow
And gradually day unfolds.
In winter, when Night longer holds
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
Longer the East inert reclines
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
At the same hour she oped her eyes
And would by candlelight arise.

Romances pleased her from the first,
Her all in all did constitute;
In love adventures she was versed,
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Not a bad fellow was her father
Though superannuated rather;
In books he saw nought to condemn
But, as he never opened them,
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
And gave himself but little pain
His daughterâ€™s book to ascertain
Which â€™neath her pillow lay till morn.
His wife was also mad upon
The works of Mr. Richardson.

She was thus fond of Richardson
Not that she had his works perused,
Or that adoring Grandison
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
But that Princess Pauline of old,
Her Moscow cousin, often told
The tale of these romantic men;
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
And she despite herself would waste
Sighs on another than her lord
Whose qualities appeared to afford
More satisfaction to her taste.
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
A noted fop who gambled hard.

Like his, her dress was always nice,
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
But contrary to her advice
The girl in marriage they unite.
Then, her distraction to allay,
The bridegroom sage without delay
Removed her to his country seat,
Where God alone knows whom she met.
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
Night separated from her spouse,
Then became busy with the house,
First reconciled and then content;
Habit was given us in distress
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.

Habit alleviates the grief
Inseparable from our lot;
This great discovery relief
And consolation soon begot.
And then she soon â€™twixt work and leisure
Found out the secret how at pleasure
To dominate her worthy lord,
And harmony was soon restored.
The workpeople she superintended,
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
And all without her husbandâ€™s leave.

In her friendsâ€™ albums, time had been,
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
And in her conversation drawled.
She wore her corset tightly bound,
The Russian N with nasal sound
She would pronounce _Ã  la FranÃ§aise_;
But soon she altered all her ways,
Corset and album and Pauline,
Her sentimental verses all,
She soon forgot, began to call
Akulka who was once Celine,
And had with waddling in the end
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.

As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
In her affairs neâ€™er interfered,
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Existence calmly sped along,
And oft at eventide a throng
Of friends unceremonious would
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
They growl a bitâ€”they scandaliseâ€”
They crack a feeble joke and smileâ€”
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
Olga the tea must superviseâ€”
â€™Tis time for supper, now for bed,
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.

They in a peaceful life preserved
Customs by ages sanctified,
Strictly the Carnival observed,
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
Of whirligigs were very fond,
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
When people with long countenance
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;
On guests their servants used to wait
By rank as settled by the State.

Thus age approached, the common doom,
And death before the husband wide
Opened the portals of the tomb
And a new diadem supplied.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
By neighbouring families bewept,
By children and by faithful wife
With deeper woe than othersâ€™ grief.
He was an honest gentleman,
And where at last his bones repose
The epitaph on marble shows:
_Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
Servant of God and brigadier,
Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.

To his Penates now returned,
Vladimir Lenski visited
His neighbourâ€™s lowly tomb and mourned
Above the ashes of the dead.
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
â€œPoor Yorick,â€ mournfully he said,
â€œHow often in thine arms I lay;
How with thy medal I would play,
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
To me he would his Olga give,
Would whisper: shall I so long live?â€â€”
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
Lenski his pencil-case took out
And an elegiac poem wrote.

Likewise an epitaph with tears
He writes upon his parentsâ€™ tomb,
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
Harvests of souls unceasingly
By Providenceâ€™s dark decree!
They blossom, ripen and they fall
And others rise ephemeral!
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
A moment effervescing stirs,
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
And our successors soon shall drive
Us from the world wherein we live.

Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Of frivolous existence, friends;
Its insignificance I know
And care but little for its ends.
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
And agitate my heart again;
And thus it is â€™twould cause me pain
Without the faintest trace to leave
This world. I do not praise desire,
Yet still apparently aspire
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
That like a friendly voice its tone
Rescue me from oblivion.

Perchance some heart â€™twill agitate,
And then the stanzas of my theme
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
Perish absorbed by Letheâ€™s stream.
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Some future ignoramus shall
My famous portrait indicate
And cry: he was a poet great!
My gratitude do not disdain,
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
Whose memory doth not refuse
My light productions to retain,
Whose hands indulgently caress
The bays of age and helplessness.

â€œWhither away? Deuce take the bard!â€â€”
â€œGood-bye, OnÃ©guine, I must go.â€â€”
â€œI wonâ€™t detain you; but â€™tis hard
To guess how you the eve pull through.â€â€”
â€œAt LÃ rinaâ€™s.â€â€”â€œHem, that is queer!
Pray is it not a tough affair
Thus to assassinate the eve?â€â€”
â€œNot at all.â€â€”â€œThat I canâ€™t conceive!
â€™Tis something of this sort I deem.
In the first place, say, am I right?
A Russian household simple quite,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
Preserves and an eternal prattle
About the rain and flax and cattle.â€â€”

â€œNo misery I see in thatâ€â€”
â€œBoredom, my friend, behold the illâ€”â€
â€œYour fashionable world I hate,
Domestic life attracts me still,
Whereâ€”â€â€”â€œWhat! another eclogue spin?
For Godâ€™s sake, Lenski, donâ€™t begin!
What! really going? â€™Tis too bad!
But Lenski, I should be so glad
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Fair source of every fine idea,
Verses and tears et cetera.
Present me.â€â€”â€œYou are joking.â€â€”â€œNo.â€â€”
â€œDelighted.â€â€”â€œWhen?â€â€”â€œThis very night.
They will receive us with delight.â€

Whilst homeward by the nearest route
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
Can we not stealthily make out
What they in conversation said?â€”
â€œHow now, OnÃ©guine, yawning still?â€â€”
â€œâ€™Tis habit, Lenski.â€â€”â€œIs your ill
More troublesome than usual?â€â€”â€œNo!
How dark the night is getting though!
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
The drive becomes monotonousâ€”
Well! LÃ rina appears to us
An ancient lady full of grace.â€”
That bilberry wine, Iâ€™m sore afraid,
The deuce with my inside has played.â€

â€œSay, of the two which was Tattiana?â€
â€œShe who with melancholy face
And silent as the maid Svetlana
Hard by the window took her place.â€â€”
â€œThe younger, youâ€™re in love with her!â€
â€œWell!â€â€”â€œI the elder should prefer,
Were I like you a bard by tradeâ€”
In Olgaâ€™s face no lifeâ€™s displayed.
â€™Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
An oval countenance and pink,
Yon silly moon upon the brink
Of the horizon she is like!â€â€”
Vladimir something curtly said
Nor further comment that night made.

Meantime OnÃ©guineâ€™s apparition
At LÃ rinaâ€™s abode produced
Quite a sensation; the position
To all good neighboursâ€™ sport conduced.
Endless conjectures all propound
And secretly their views expound.
What jokes and guesses now abound,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
In fact, some people were assured
The wedding-day had been arranged,
But the date subsequently changed
Till proper rings could be procured.
On Lenskiâ€™s matrimonial fate
They long ago had held debate.

Of course Tattiana was annoyed
By such allusions scandalous,
Yet was her inmost soul oâ€™erjoyed
With satisfaction marvellous,
As in her heart the thought sank home,
I am in love, my hour hath come!
Thus in the earth the seed expands
Obedient to warm Springâ€™s commands.
Long time her young imagination
By indolence and languor fired
The fated nutriment desired;
And long internal agitation
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
She waited forâ€”I donâ€™t know whom!

The fatal hour had come at lastâ€”
She oped her eyes and cried: â€™tis he!
Alas! for now before her passed
The same warm vision constantly;
Now all things round about repeat
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
His name: the tenderness of home
Tiresome unto her hath become
And the kind-hearted servitors:
Immersed in melancholy thought,
She hears of conversation nought
And hated casual visitors,
Their coming which no man expects,
And stay whose length none recollects.

Now with what eager interest
She the delicious novel reads,
With what avidity and zest
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
All the creations which below
From happy inspiration flow,
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
Malek Adel and De Linar,
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
And that unrivalled paragon,
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
A single being: â€™twas in fine
No other than OnÃ©guine mine.

Dreaming herself the heroine
Of the romances she preferred,
Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,â€”
Tattiana through the forest erred,
And the bad book accompanies.
Upon those pages she descries
Her passionâ€™s faithful counterpart,
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
She murmurs in an undertone
A letter for her hero meant:
That hero, though his merit shone,
Was certainly no Grandison.

Alas! my friends, the years flit by
And after them at headlong pace
The evanescent fashions fly
In motley and amusing chase.
The world is ever altering!
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
And courtier, fop, and usurer
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Time was, the poetâ€™s tender quill
In hopes of everlasting fame
A finished madrigal would frame
Or couplets more ingenious still;
Time was, a valiant general might
Serve who could neither read nor write.

Time was, in style magniloquent
Authors replete with sacred fire
Their heroes used to represent
All that perfection could desire;
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
Their idols they were wont to invest
With intellect, a taste refined,
And handsome countenance combined,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
The excited hero in a trice
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
And in the final tome we learnt,
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.

But now our minds are mystified
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
Vice in romance is glorified
And triumphs in career erotic.
The monsters of the British Muse
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
The idols of their adoration
A Vampire fond of meditation,
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Byronâ€™s capricious phantasy
Could in romantic mantle drape
Eâ€™en hopeless egoismâ€™s dark shape.

My friends, what means this odd digression?
May be that I by heavenâ€™s decrees
Shall abdicate the bardâ€™s profession,
And shall adopt some new caprice.
Thus having braved Apolloâ€™s rage
With humble prose Iâ€™ll fill my page
And a romance in ancient style
Shall my declining years beguile;
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
The torment born of crime unseen,
But shall depict the touching scene
Of Russian domesticity;
I will descant on loveâ€™s sweet dream,
The olden time shall be my theme.

Old peopleâ€™s simple conversations
My unpretending page shall fill,
Their offspringâ€™s innocent flirtations
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
Their Jealousy and separation
And tears of reconciliation:
Fresh cause of quarrel then Iâ€™ll find,
But finally in wedlock bind.
The passionate speeches Iâ€™ll repeat,
Accents of rapture or despair
I uttered to my lady fair
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Then they came easily enow,
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.

Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
Thouâ€™lt suffer, dearest, but before,
Hope with her fascinating power
To dire contentment shall give birth
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
Thouâ€™lt quaff loveâ€™s sweet envenomed stream,
Fantastic images shall swarm
In thy imagination warm,
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
And wheresoeâ€™er thy footsteps err,
Confront thy fated torturer!

Loveâ€™s pangs Tattiana agonize.
She seeks the garden in her needâ€”
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
And cares not farther to proceed;
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
And now â€™tis night, the guardian moon
Sails her allotted course on high,
And from the misty woodland nigh
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
And thus unto her nurse did say:

â€œNurse, â€™tis so close I cannot rest.
Open the windowâ€”sit by me.â€
â€œWhat ails thee, dear?â€â€”â€œI feel depressed.
Relate some ancient history.â€
â€œBut which, my dear?â€”In days of yore
Within my memory I bore
Many an ancient legend which
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
But now my mind is desolate,
What once I knew is clean forgotâ€”
Alas! how wretched now my lot!â€
â€œBut tell me, nurse, can you relate
The days which to your youth belong?
Were you in love when you were young?â€â€”

â€œAlack! Tattiana,â€ she replied,
â€œWe never loved in days of old,
My mother-in-law who lately died
Had killed me had the like been told.â€
â€œHow came you then to wed a man?â€â€”
â€œWhy, as God ordered! My Ivan
Was younger than myself, my light,
For I myself was thirteen quite;
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
Her suit before my parents pressing:
At last my father gave his blessing,
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
And led me off to church with song.â€

â€œThen amongst strangers I was leftâ€”
But I perceive thou dost not heedâ€”â€
â€œAlas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
Mortally sick I am indeed.
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrainâ€”â€
â€œMy darling child, thou art in pain.â€”
The Lord deliver her and save!
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
Iâ€™ll sprinkle thee with holy water.â€”
How thy hands burn!â€â€”â€œDear nurse, Iâ€™m well.
I amâ€”in loveâ€”you knowâ€”donâ€™t tell!â€
â€œThe Lord be with thee, O my daughter!â€â€”
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.

â€œI am in love,â€ her whispers tell
The aged woman in her woe:
â€œMy heartâ€™s delight, thou art not well.â€â€”
â€œI am in love, nurse! leave me now.â€
Behold! the moon was shining bright
And showed with an uncertain light
Tattianaâ€™s beauty, pale with care,
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
And on the footstool sitting down
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
A kerchief round her silver hair
The aged nurse in ample gown,
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
Enchanted by the moonâ€™s pale beam.

But borne in spirit far away
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
And starting suddenly doth say:
â€œNurse, leave me. I would be alone.
Pen, paper bring: the table too
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall goâ€”
Good-night.â€ Behold! she is alone!
â€™Tis silentâ€”on her shines the moonâ€”
Upon her elbow she reclines,
And Eugene ever in her soul
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
Wherein love innocently pines.
Now it is ready to be sentâ€”
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?

I have known beauties cold and raw
As Winter in their purity,
Striking the intellect with awe
By dull insensibility,
And I admired their common sense
And natural benevolence,
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
For on their brows I trembling read
The inscription oâ€™er the gates of Hell
â€œAbandon hope for ever here!â€
Love to inspire doth woe appear
To suchâ€”delightful to repel.
Perchance upon the Neva eâ€™en
Similar dames ye may have seen.

Amid submissive herds of men
Virgins miraculous I see,
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Alike by sighs and flattery.
But what astonished do I find
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
A timid love to banishment?â€”
On fresh allurements they are bent,
At least by show of sympathy;
At least their accents and their words
Appear attuned to softer chords;
And then with blind credulity
The youthful lover once again
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.

Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?â€”
Because in singleness of thought
She never of deception dreamed
But trusted the ideal she wrought?â€”
Because her passion wanted art,
Obeyed the impulses of heart?â€”
Because she was so innocent,
That Heaven her character had blent
With an imagination wild,
With intellect and strong volition
And a determined disposition,
An ardent heart and yet so mild?â€”
Doth loveâ€™s incautiousness in her
So irremissible appear?

O ye whom tender love hath pained
Without the ken of parents both,
Whose hearts responsive have remained
To the impressions of our youth,
The all-entrancing joys of loveâ€”
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
The mystic lines to tear away
A loverâ€™s letter might convey,
Or into bold hands anxiously
Have eâ€™er a precious tress consigned,
Or even, silent and resigned,
When separationâ€™s hour drew nigh,
Have felt loveâ€™s agitated kiss
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,â€”

With unanimity complete,
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
The sneers of critics superfine;
And you, O maids immaculate,
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Eâ€™en as the presence of a snake,
I the same admonition make.
Who knows? with loveâ€™s consuming flame
Perchance you also soon may burn,
Then to some gallant in your turn
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
The triumph of a conquest new.
The God of Love is after you!

A coquette loves by calculation,
Tattianaâ€™s love was quite sincere,
A love which knew no limitation,
Even as the love of children dear.
She did not think â€œprocrastination
Enhances love in estimation
And thus secures the prey we seek.
His vanity first let us pique
With hope and then perplexity,
Excruciate the heart and late
With jealous fire resuscitate,
Lest jaded with satiety,
The artful prisoner should seek
Incessantly his chains to break.â€

I still a complication view,
My countryâ€™s honour and repute
Demands that I translate for you
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
At Russ she was by no means clever
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
And in her native language she
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
So she in French herself expressed.
I cannot help it I declare,
Though hitherto a lady neâ€™er
In Russ her love made manifest,
And never hath our language proud
In correspondence been allowed.

They wish that ladies should, I hear,
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
I canâ€™t conceive a little dear
With the â€œWell-Wisherâ€ in her hand!
I ask, all ye who poets are,
Is it not true? the objects fair,
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
To whom your hearts were consecrate,â€”
Did they not all the Russian tongue
With little knowledge and that wrong
In charming fashion mutilate?
Did not their lips with foreign speech
The native Russian tongue impeach?

God grant I meet not at a ball
Or at a promenade mayhap,
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
Or a professor in tulle cap.
As rosy lips without a smile,
The Russian language I deem vile
Without grammatical mistakes.
May be, and this my terror wakes,
The fair of the next generation,
As every journal now entreats,
Will teach grammatical conceits,
Introduce verse in conversation.
But Iâ€”what is all this to me?
Will to the old times faithful be.

Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
With inexact pronunciation
Raises within my breast as oft
As formerly much agitation.
Repentance wields not now her spell
And gallicisms I love as well
As the sins of my youthful days
Or Bogdanovitchâ€™s sweet lays.
But I must now employ my Muse
With the epistle of my fair;
I promised!â€”Did I so?â€”Well, there!
Now I am ready to refuse.
I know that Parnyâ€™s tender pen
Is no more cherished amongst men.

Bard of the â€œFeasts,â€ and mournful breast,
If thou wert sitting by my side,
With this immoderate request
I should alarm our friendship tried:
In one of thine enchanting lays
To russify the foreign phrase
Of my impassioned heroine.
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
I yield with a low reverence;
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
Where melancholy rocks arise
He wanders in his indolence;
Careless of fame his spirit high
Hears not my importunity!

Tattianaâ€™s letter I possess,
I guard it as a holy thing,
And though I read it with distress,
Iâ€™m oâ€™er it ever pondering.
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
This gentle daring who could guess?
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
Attractive in its banefulness?
I cannot understand. But lo!
A feeble version read below,
A print without the pictureâ€™s grace,
Or, as it were, the Freischutzâ€™ score
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl oâ€™er.

Tattiana moans and now she sighs
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
Even the rosy wafer dries
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
Her head upon her breast declines
And an enchanting shoulder shines
From her half-open vest of night.
But lo! already the moonâ€™s light
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Silvers the brook; the shepherdâ€™s horn
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
â€™Tis day, the family downstairs,
But nought for this Tattiana cares.

The break of day she doth not see,
But sits in bed with air depressed,
Nor on the letter yet hath she
The image of her seal impressed.
But gray Phillippevna the door
Opened with care, and entering bore
A cup of tea upon a tray.
â€œâ€™Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
My beauty, thou art ready too.
My morning birdie, yesternight
I was half silly with affright.
But praised be God! in health art thou!
The pains of night have wholly fled,
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!â€

â€œAh! nurse, a favour do for me!â€â€”
â€œCommand me, darling, what you chooseâ€â€”
â€œDo notâ€”you mightâ€”suspicious be;
But look youâ€”ah! do not refuse.â€
â€œI call to witness God on highâ€”â€
â€œThen send your grandson quietly
To take this letter to Oâ€” Well!
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tellâ€”
Command him not to say a wordâ€”
I mean my name not to repeat.â€
â€œTo whom is it to go, my sweet?
Of late I have been quite absurd,â€”
So many neighbours here existâ€”
Am I to go through the whole list?â€

â€œHow dull you are this morning, nurse!â€
â€œMy darling, growing old am I!
In age the memory gets worse,
But I was sharp in times gone by.
In times gone by thy bare commandâ€”â€
â€œOh! nurse, nurse, you donâ€™t understand!
What is thy cleverness to me?
The letter is the thing, you see,â€”
OnÃ©guineâ€™s letter!â€â€”â€œAh! the thing!
Now donâ€™t be cross with me, my soul,
You know that I am now a foolâ€”
But why are your cheeks whitening?â€
â€œNothing, good nurse, thereâ€™s nothing wrong,
But send your grandson before long.â€

No answer all that day was borne.
Another passed; â€™twas just the same.
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Olgaâ€™s admirer came that day:
â€œTell me, why doth your comrade stay?â€
The hostess doth interrogate:
â€œHe hath neglected us of late.â€â€”
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quickâ€”
â€œHe promised here this day to ride,â€
Lenski unto the dame replied,
â€œThe post hath kept him, it is like.â€
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
As if he cruelly had joked!

â€™Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
Shrill sang the _samovar_ at eve,
The china teapot too ye might
In clouds of steam above perceive.
Into the cups already sped
By Olgaâ€™s hand distributed
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
And a boy handed round the cream.
Tania doth by the casement linger
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And traces with a slender finger
Upon its damp opacity,
The mystic monogram, O. E.

In the meantime her spirit sinks,
Her weary eyes are filled with tearsâ€”
A horseâ€™s hoofs she hearsâ€”She shrinks!
Nearer they comeâ€”Eugene appears!
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
From hall to yard and garden flies,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
She fears and like an arrow rushes
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
The bridge and alley to the lake,
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
Till out of breath upon a seat

She sank.â€”â€œHeâ€™s here! Eugene is here!
Merciful God, what will he deem?â€
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Guards fondly hopeâ€™s uncertain dream.
She waits, on fire her trembling frameâ€”
Will he pursue?â€”But no one came.
She heard of servant-maids the note,
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
Singing in chorus all the while.
(This by command; for it was found,
However cherries might abound,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruitâ€”
Device of rural minds acute!)

They sang, whilst negligently seated,
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Tattiana with impatience waited
Until her heart less high should boundâ€”
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
But tremor still her frame possessed,
Nor did her blushes fade away,
More crimson every moment they.
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
With iridescent wing doth flap
When captured in a schoolboyâ€™s cap;
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
She from the winter corn espies
A sportsman who in covert lies.

But finally she heaves a sigh,
And rising from her bench proceeds;
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Tattiana faltered, and became
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
But this adventureâ€™s consequence
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
I am not strong enough to state;
I, after so much eloquence,
Must take a walk and rest a bitâ€”
Some day Iâ€™ll somehow finish it.

The less we love a lady fair
The easier â€™tis to gain her grace,
And the more surely we ensnare
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
Time was when cold seduction strove
To swagger as the art of love,
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
But this amusement delicate
Was worthy of that old baboon,
Our fathers used to dote upon;
The Lovelaces are out of date,
Their glory with their heels of red
And long perukes hath vanishÃ¨d.

For who imposture can endure,
A constant harping on one tune,
Serious endeavours to assure
What everybody long has known;
Ever to hear the same replies
And overcome antipathies
Which never have existed, eâ€™en
In little maidens of thirteen?
And what like menaces fatigues,
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
Epistles of six sheets or near,
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
And husbandsâ€™ tedious amity?

Such were the musings of Eugene.
He in the early years of life
Had a deluded victim been
Of error and the passionsâ€™ strife.
By daily life deteriorated,
Awhile this beauty captivated,
And that no longer could inspire.
Slowly exhausted by desire,
Yet satiated with success,
In solitude or worldly din,
He heard his soulâ€™s complaint within,
With laughter smothered weariness:
And thus he spent eight years of time,
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.

Though beauty he no more adored,
He still made love in a queer way;
Rebuffedâ€”as quickly reassured,
Jiltedâ€”glad of a holiday.
Without enthusiasm he met
The fair, nor parted with regret,
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
Thus a guest with composure will
To take a hand at whist oft come:
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
And straight returning whence he came,
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
And in the morning doth not know
Whither that evening he will go.

However, Taniaâ€™s letter reading,
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
The language of her girlish pleading
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
He called to mind Tattianaâ€™s grace,
Pallid and melancholy face,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
His spirit sank with strange delight.
May be the empire of the sense,
Regained authority awhile,
But he desired not to beguile
Such open-hearted innocence.
But to the garden once again
Wherein we lately left the twain.

Two minutes they in silence spent,
OnÃ©guine then approached and said:
â€œYou have a letter to me sent.
Do not excuse yourself. I read
Confessions which a trusting heart
May well in innocence impart.
Charming is your sincerity,
Feelings which long had ceased to be
It wakens in my breast again.
But I came not to adulate:
Your frankness I shall compensate
By an avowal just as plain.
An ear to my confession lend;
To thy decree my will I bend.

â€œIf the domestic hearth could blessâ€”
My sum of happiness contained;
If wife and children to possess
A happy destiny ordained:
If in the scenes of home I might
Eâ€™en for an instant find delight,
Then, I say truly, none but thee
I would desire my bride to beâ€”
I say without poetic phrase,
Found the ideal of my youth,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
As partner of my mournful days,
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
And be as happyâ€”as I might.

â€œBut strange am I to happiness;
â€™Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
Me your perfections would not bless;
I am not worthy them in aught;
And honestly â€™tis my belief
Our union would produce but grief.
Though now my love might be intense,
Habit would bring indifference.
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
But merely to exasperate;
Judge then what roses would be ours,
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
For us, may be for many a year.

â€œWhat can be drearier than the house,
Wherein the miserable wife
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
And leads a solitary life?
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Is full of frigid jealousy,
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
Such am I. This did ye expect,
When in simplicity ye wrote
Your innocent and charming note
With so much warmth and intellect?
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
This lot in life with stern decree?

â€œIdeas and time neâ€™er backward move;
My soul I cannot renovateâ€”
I love you with a brotherâ€™s love,
Perchance one more affectionate.
Listen to me without disdain.
A maid hath oft, may yet again
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
As in their turn the seasons roll.
â€™Tis evidently Heavenâ€™s will
You fall in love again. But stillâ€”
Learn to possess more self-control.
Not all will like myself proceedâ€”
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.â€

Thus did our friend OnÃ©guine preach:
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
Attentive listened to his speech,
All breathless and without replies.
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
(_Mechanically_, let us add),
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
And, hanging down her head, the maid
Around the garden homeward hies.
Together they returned, nor word
Of censure for the same incurred;
The country hath its liberties
And privileges nice allowed,
Even as Moscow, city proud.

Confess, O ye who this peruse,
OnÃ©guine acted very well
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
â€™Twas not the first time, I can tell
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Spared him not their asperities.
His friends and also enemies
(One and the same thing it may be)
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
Yes! every one must have his foes,
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
Iâ€™ve had to make for having friends!

But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
Dark, unavailing reverie,
I just hint, in parenthesis,
There is no stupid calumny
Born of a babbler in a loft
And by the world repeated oft,
There is no fishmarket retort
And no ridiculous report,
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Where fashionable circles meet
A hundred times will not repeat,
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
And yet he in your cause would strive
And loves you asâ€”a relative!

Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Are all your relatives quite well?
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
For your instruction here to tell
What I by relatives conceive?
These are your relatives, believe:
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
With spiritual tenderness;
Whom, as the custom is of men,
We visit about Christmas Day,
Or by a card our homage pay,
That until Christmas comes again
They may forget that we exist.
And soâ€”God bless them, if He list.

In this the love of the fair sex
Beats that of friends and relatives:
In love, although its tempests vex,
Our liberty at least survives:
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
The natural fickleness of passion,
The torrent of opinion,
And the fair sex as light as down!
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Should be respected throughout life
By every proper-minded wife,
And this the faithful one allows,
When in as instant she is lost,â€”
Satan will jest, and at loveâ€™s cost.

Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
Where is he who doth not deceive?
Who words and actions will adjust
To standards in which we believe?
Oh! who is not calumnious?
Who labours hard to humour us?
To whom are our misfortunes grief
And who is not a tiresome thief?
My venerated reader, oh!
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Spare yourself unavailing pain
And all your love on self bestow;
A worthy object â€™tis, and well
I know thereâ€™s none more amiable.

But from the interview what flowed?
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
The insensate fire of love still glowed
Nor discontinued to distress
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
Tattiana more than ever burned
With hopeless passion: from her bed
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Her health, lifeâ€™s sweetness and its bloom,
Her smile and maidenly repose,
All vanished as an echo goes.
Across her youth a shade had come,
As when the tempestâ€™s veil is drawn
Across the smiling face of dawn.

Alas! Tattiana fades away,
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
Listless is she the livelong day
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Shaking with serious air the head,
In whispers low the neighbours said:
â€™Tis time she to the altar went!
But enough! Now, â€™tis my intent
The imagination to enliven
With love which happiness extends;
Against my inclination, friends,
By sympathy I have been driven.
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
My heroine, Tattiana dear.

Vladimir, hourly more a slave
To youthful Olgaâ€™s beauty bright,
Into delicious bondage gave
His ardent soul with full delight.
Always together, eventide
Found them in darkness side by side,
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
Around the meadow and the grove.
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
But with confused and bashful air,
Lenski at intervals would dare,
If Olga smilingly approve,
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Or kiss the border of her dress.

To Olga frequently he would
Some nice instructive novel read,
Whose author nature understood
Better than Chateaubriand did
Yet sometimes pages two or three
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
For maidenâ€™s hearing deemed unfit),
He somewhat blushing would omit:
Far from the rest the pair would creep
And (elbows on the table) they
A game of chess would often play,
Buried in meditation deep,
Till absently Vladimir took
With his own pawn alas! his rook!

Homeward returning, he at home
Is occupied with Olga fair,
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
He leisurely adorns for her.
Landscapes thereon he would design,
A tombstone, Aphroditeâ€™s shrine,
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
The â€œin memoriamâ€ pages sought,
Where many another hand had signed
A tender couplet he combined,
A register of fleeting thought,
A flimsy trace of musings past
Which might for many ages last.

Surely ye all have overhauled
A country damselâ€™s album trim,
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
From first to last page to the rim.
Behold! orthography despising,
Metreless verses recognizing
By friendship how they were abused,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
Upon the opening page ye find:
_Quâ€™ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_
Subscribed, _toujours Ã  vous, Annette;_
And on the last one, underlined:
_Who in thy love finds more delight
Beyond this may attempt to write_.

Infallibly you there will find
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
And vows will probably be signed:
_Affectionately yours till death_.
Some army poet therein may
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
In such an album with delight
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
Delighted glances in return;
That afterwards with evil smile
They would not solemnly debate
If cleverly or not I prate.

But, O ye tomes without compare,
Which from the devilâ€™s bookcase start,
Albums magnificent which scare
The fashionable rhymesterâ€™s heart!
Yea! although rendered beauteous
By Tolstoyâ€™s pencil marvellous,
Though Baratynski verses penned,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
Wheneâ€™er a brilliant courtly dame
Presents her quarto amiably,
Despair and anger seize on me,
And a malicious epigram
Trembles upon my lips from spite,â€”
And madrigals Iâ€™m asked to write!

But Lenski madrigals neâ€™er wrote
In Olgaâ€™s album, youthful maid,
To purest love he tuned his note
Nor frigid adulation paid.
What never was remarked or heard
Of Olga he in song averred;
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
Both natural and truthful seemed.
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
In amorous flights when so inspired,
Singing God knows what maid admired,
And all thy precious elegies,
Sometime collected, shall relate
The story of thy life and fate.

Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Incited by his stormy Muse
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
But Olga would not such peruse.
When poets lachrymose recite
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
Their own productions, some insist
No greater pleasure can exist
Just so! that modest swain is blest
Who reads his visionary theme
To the fair object of his dream,
A beauty languidly at rest,
Yes, happyâ€”though she at his side
By other thoughts be occupied.

But I the products of my Muse,
Consisting of harmonious lays,
To my old nurse alone peruse,
Companion of my childhoodâ€™s days.
Or, after dinnerâ€™s dull repast,
I by the button-hole seize fast
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
And breathe a drama in his ear.
Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
I sail upon my lake at times
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Take to their wings and fly away.

But to OnÃ©guine! _A propos!_
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
His daily occupations, lo!
Minutely I will now portray.
A hermitâ€™s life OnÃ©guine led,
At seven in summer rose from bed,
And clad in airy costume took
His course unto the running brook.
There, aping Gulnareâ€™s bard, he spanned
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
And then a cup of coffee drank,
Some wretched journal in his hand;
Then dressed himself...


Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
The uncontaminated kiss
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
A dinner, whimsical each course,
A bottle of a vintage white
And solitude and calm delight.
Such was OnÃ©guineâ€™s sainted life,
And such unconsciously he led,
Nor marked how summerâ€™s prime had fled
In aimless ease and far from strife,
The curse of commonplace delight.
And town and friends forgotten quite.

This northern summer of our own,
On winters of the south a skit,
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Though we will not acknowledge it.
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
The tiny sun shone less on high
And shorter had the days become.
The forests in mysterious gloom
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
Upon the earth a mist did lie
And many a caravan on high
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
A weary season was at handâ€”
November at the gate did stand.

The morn arises foggy, cold,
The silent fields no peasant nears,
The wolf upon the highways bold
With his ferocious mate appears.
Detecting him the passing horse
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
And wisely gallops to the hill.
No more at dawn the shepherd will
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
Of horn in circle call them round.
Singing inside her hut the maid
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.

Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Oâ€™er all a sheet of silvery dust
(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
Behold! than polished floor more nice
The shining river clothed in ice;
A joyous troop of little boys
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
Thinking to float upon the stream,
Descends the bank with care extreme,
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
Which falls in starry flakes below.

How in the country pass this time?
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
In winter by its blank and dim
And naked uniformity.
On horseback gallop oâ€™er the steppe!
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
His footing on the treacherous rime
And may fall headlong any time.
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
Keep your accounts! Youâ€™d rather not?
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
Will pass; the same to-morrow tryâ€”
Youâ€™ll spend your winter famously!

A true Childe Harold my Eugene
To idle musing was a prey;
At morn an icy bath within
He sat, and then the livelong day,
Alone within his habitation
And buried deep in meditation,
He round the billiard-table stalked,
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
When evening oâ€™er the landscape looms,
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
A table to the fire is brought,
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
â€œBring dinner now without delay!â€

Upon the table in a trice
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
For the young poet they display.
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
Its ebullition foaming white
(Like other things I could relate)
My heart of old would captivate.
The last poor obol I was worthâ€”
Was it not so?â€”for thee I gave,
And thy inebriating wave
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
And oh! what verses, what delights,
Delicious visions, jests and fights!

Alas! my stomach it betrays
With its exhilarating flow,
And I confess that now-a-days
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
Seductive, animated, bright,
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
Who in the agony of grief
Is ever ready with relief,
Assistance ever will extend,
Or quietly partake our woe.
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!

The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
The golden ember now enshrines,
And barely visible the smoke
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
The goblet still is bubbling brightâ€”
Outside descend the mists of night.
How pleasantly the evening jogs
When oâ€™er a glass with friends we prate
Just at the hour we designate
The time between the wolf and dogsâ€”
I cannot tell on what pretenceâ€”
But lo! the friends to chat commence.

â€œHow are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?â€â€”
â€œThe family are all quite wellâ€”
Give me just half a glass of wineâ€”
They sent their complimentsâ€”but oh!
How charming Olgaâ€™s shoulders grow!
Her figure perfect grows with time!
She is an angel! We sometime
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
My friend, â€™tis but to pay a debt,
For twice you came to them and yet
You never since your nose have shown.
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
They have invited you this week.â€

â€œMe?â€â€”â€œYes! It is Tattianaâ€™s fÃªte
Next Saturday. The LÃ rina
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
Make up your mind to go there.â€â€”â€œAh!
It will be by a mob beset
Of every sort and every set!â€â€”
â€œNot in the least, assured am I!â€â€”
â€œWho will be there?â€â€”â€œThe family.
Do me a favour and appear.
Will you?â€â€”â€œAgreed.â€â€”â€œI thank you, friend,â€
And saying this Vladimir drained
His cup unto his maiden dear.
Then touching Olga they depart
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!

He was most gay. The happy date
In three weeks would arrive for them;
The secrets of the marriage state
And loveâ€™s delicious diadem
With rapturous longing he awaits,
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Hymenâ€™s embarrassments, distress,
And freezing fits of weariness.
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
In life domestic see a string
Of pictures painful harrowing,
A novel in Lafontaineâ€™s style,
My wretched Lenskiâ€™s fate I mourn,
He seemed for matrimony born.

He was beloved: or say at least,
He thought so, and existence charmed.
The credulous indeed are blest,
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
Or, parable more flattering,
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
But wretched who anticipates,
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
Who every gesture, every phrase
In true interpretation hates:
Whose heart experience icy made
And yet oblivion forbade.

That year the autumn season late
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
All Nature winter seemed to await,
Till January fell no snowâ€”
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
Park, garden, palings, yard below
And roofs near morn blanched oâ€™er with snow;
Upon the windows tracery,
The trees in silvery array,
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
And the far mountains daintily
Oâ€™erspread with Winterâ€™s carpet bright,
All so distinct, and all so white!

Winter! The peasant blithely goes
To labour in his sledge forgot,
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
Just manages a feeble trot
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,
Its driver seated on the rim
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
Himself transformed into a hack;
To freeze his finger hath begun,
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
His mother from the door doth scold.

In scenes like these it may be though,
Ye feel but little interest,
They are all natural and low,
Are not with elegance impressed.
Another bard with art divine
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
The first appearance of the snows
And all the joys which Winter knows.
He will delight you, I am sure,
When he in ardent verse portrays
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
But competition I abjure
Either with him or thee in song,
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.

Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Herself not knowing well the reason,
The Russian winter did adore
And the cold beauties of the season:
On sunny days the glistening rime,
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
These evenings as in days of old
The LÃ rinas would celebrate,
The servants used to congregate
And the young ladies fortunes told,
And every year distributed
Journeys and warriors to wed.

Tattiana in traditions old
Believed, the peopleâ€™s wisdom weird,
In dreams and what the moon foretold
And what she from the cards inferred.
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
Mysteriously all objects near
A hidden meaning could impart,
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
Tattiana certainly infers
That guests approach: and when above
The new moonâ€™s crescent slim she spied,
Suddenly to the left hand side,

She trembled and grew deadly pale.
Or a swift meteor, may be,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
And disappear in space; then she
Would haste in agitation dire
To mutter her concealed desire
Ere the bright messenger had set.
When in her walks abroad she met
A friar black approaching near,
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
Had run across her path at speed,
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Anticipating woe she pined,
Certain misfortune near opined.

Wherefore? She found a secret joy
In horror for itself alone,
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
Thus her perversity hath shown.
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
Before whose inexperienced sight
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
To peer into the future tries.
Old age through spectacles too peers,
Although the destined coffin nears,
Having lost all in life we prize.
It matters not. Hope eâ€™en to these
With childlike lisp will lie to please.

Tattiana gazed with curious eye
On melted wax in water poured;
The clue unto some mystery
She deemed its outline might afford.
Rings from a dish of water full
In order due the maidens pull;
But when Tattianaâ€™s hand had taâ€™en
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
_The peasants there are rich as kings,
They shovel silver with a spade,
He whom we sing to shall be made
Happy and glorious_. But this brings
With sad refrain misfortune near.
Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.

Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
Sailed silently in unisonâ€”
Tattiana in the yard appears
In a half-open dressing-gown
And bends her mirror on the moon,
But trembling on the mirror dark
The sad moon only could remark.
List! the snow crunchesâ€”he draws nigh!
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
â€œWhat is your name?â€ The boor looked dazed,
And â€œAgathonâ€ replied, amazed.

Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
By night prepared for sorcery,
And in the bathroom did command
To lay two covers secretly.
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
And I, remembering Svetlana,
Become alarmed. So never mind!
Iâ€™m not for witchcraft now inclined.
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Undressed herself and went to bed
And soon Lel hovered oâ€™er her head.
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
A little virgin mirror peeps.
â€™Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.

A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
She dreamt she journeyed oâ€™er a field
All covered up with snow in heaps,
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
A stream, by winterâ€™s ice unbound,
Impetuously clove its way
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
Two poles together glued by ice,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
Spanned the unbridled torrent oâ€™er;
Beside the thundering abyss
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Rooted unto the spot remained.

As if against obstruction sore
Tattiana oâ€™er the stream complained;
To help her to the other shore
No one appeared to lend a hand.
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
And what from its recess appears?
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
He roars, and â€œAh!â€ Tattiana cries.
He offers her his murderous paw;
She nerves herself from her alarm
And leans upon the monsterâ€™s arm,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
Passes the torrent But alack!
Bruin is marching at her back!

She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Accelerates her hasty pace,
But cannot anyhow evade
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
A forest now she sees in front
With fir-trees standing motionless
In melancholy loveliness,
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
The shining orbs of night appear;
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
And all in snow is buried deep.

The wood she entersâ€”bear behind,â€”
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
Now a long branch itself entwined
Around her neck, now violently
Away her golden earrings tore;
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Her handkerchief she loses now;
No time to pick it up! afraid,
She hears the bear behind her press,
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
For shame lift up the modest maid.
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
Until her powers of running fail.

She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
Adroitly seized and carried her;
Submissive as if in a swoon,
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
He dragged her by a forest road
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
A tangled wilderness around.
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Within resounded shriek and shout:
â€œMy chum lives here,â€ Bruin grunts out.
â€œWarm yourself here a little space!â€
Straight for the entrance then he made
And her upon the threshold laid.

Recovering, Tania gazes round;
Bear goneâ€”she at the threshold placed;
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
As if it were some funeral feast.
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
She peeped through a chink of the door.
What doth she see? Around the board
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
A canine face with horns thereon,
Another with cockâ€™s head appeared,
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
There an imperious skeleton;
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
A shape half cat and half a crane.

Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
A crab upon a spider rides,
Perched on a gooseâ€™s neck a skull
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
A windmill too a jig performs
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
When in that company she saw
Him who inspired both love and awe,
The hero we immortalize.
OnÃ©guine sat the table by
And viewed the door with cunning eye.

All bustle when he makes a sign:
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
He knits his browsâ€”â€™tis silent all.
He there is masterâ€”that is plain;
Tattiana courage doth regain
And grown more curious by far
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
The wind rose instantly, blew out
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
OnÃ©guine lightning glances shot;
Furious he from the table rose;
All arise. To the door he goes.

Terror assails her. Hastily
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
She cannotâ€”then impatiently
She strains her throat to force a cryâ€”
She cannotâ€”Eugene oped the door
And the young girl appeared before
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
Are turned upon her. All combine
In one great shout: sheâ€™s mine! sheâ€™s mine!

â€œMine!â€ cried Eugene with savage tone.
The troop of apparitions fled,
And in the frosty night alone
Remained with him the youthful maid.
With tranquil air OnÃ©guine leads
Tattiana to a corner, bids
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
Her shoulderâ€”Olga swiftly cameâ€”
And Lenski followedâ€”a light brokeâ€”
His fist OnÃ©guine fiercely shook
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
The unbidden guests he roughly chidesâ€”
Tattiana motionless abides.

The strife grew furious and Eugene
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Struck Lenski deadâ€”across the scene
Dark shadows thickenâ€”a dread cry
Was uttered, and the cabin shookâ€”
Tattiana terrified awoke.
She gazed around herâ€”it was day.
Lo! through the frozen windows play
Auroraâ€™s ruddy rays of lightâ€”
The door flew openâ€”Olga came,
More blooming than the Boreal flame
And swifter than the swallowâ€™s flight.
â€œCome,â€ she cried, â€œsister, tell me eâ€™en
Whom you in slumber may have seen.â€

But she, her sister never heeding,
With book in hand reclined in bed,
Page after page continued reading,
But no reply unto her made.
Although her book did not contain
The bardâ€™s enthusiastic strain,
Nor precepts sage nor pictures eâ€™en,
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
Who dreams expound and prophecies.

Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Unto their solitude one day,
This monument of thought profound
Tattiana purchased with a stray
Tome of â€œMalvina,â€ and but three
And a half rubles down gave she;
Also, to equalise the scales,
She got a book of nursery tales,
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Marmontel also, tome the third;
Tattiana every day conferred
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
She consolation thence obtainedâ€”
Inseparable they remained.

The dream left terror in its train.
Not knowing its interpretation,
Tania the meaning would obtain
Of such a dread hallucination.
Tattiana to the index flies
And alphabetically tries
The words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
Et cetera_; but nothing showed
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
Though the foul vision promise made
Of a most mournful episode,
And many a day thereafter laid
A load of care upon the maid.

â€œBut lo! forth from the valleys dun
With purple hand Aurora leads,
Swift following in her wake, the sun,â€
And a grand festival proceeds.
The LÃ rinas were since sunrise
Oâ€™erwhelmed with guests; by families
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Crush and confusion in the hall,
Latest arrivalsâ€™ salutations,
Barking, young ladiesâ€™ osculations,
Shouts, laughter, jamming â€™gainst the wall,
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.

Bringing his partner corpulent
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
And the SkatÃ¨nines, aged pair,
With all their progeny were there,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
PÃ©tÃ²ushkoff, the provincial swell;
BouyÃ noff too, my cousin, wore
His wadded coat and cap with peak
(Surely you know him as I speak);
And FliÃ noff, pensioned councillor,
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.

The family of Kharlikoff,
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
In Taniaâ€™s praise in pouch he brought,
Known unto children perfectly:
_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
He found them in an almanac,
And the sagacious Triquet back
To light had brought them from their dust,
Whilst he â€œbelle Ninaâ€ had the face
By â€œbelle Tattianaâ€ to replace.

Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
Of old maids the divinity,
And comfort of each country dame,
The captain of a company.
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
The military band will play.
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
So there will be a dance to-night.
Girls in anticipation skip!
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
They hand in hand to table go.
The maids beside Tattiana keepâ€”
Men opposite. The cross they sign
And chattering loud sit down to dine.

Ceased for a space all chattering.
Jaws are at work. On every side
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
But by degrees the crowd begin
To raise a clamour and a din:
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
They shout and no one lists at all.
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
His entrance with OnÃ©guine. â€œAh!
At last the author!â€ cries Mamma.
The guests make room; aside each takes
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
The friends are called and quickly placed.

Right opposite Tattiana placed,
She, than the morning moon more pale,
More timid than a doe long chased,
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Anew the flames of passion start
Within her; she is sick at heart;
The two friendsâ€™ compliments she hears
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
The poor girl fell into a faint,
But strength of mind and self-restraint
Prevailed at last. She in reply
Said something in an undertone
And at the table sat her down.

To tragedy, the fainting fit,
And female tears hysterical,
OnÃ©guine could not now submit,
For long he had endured them all.
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
At a great feast against desire,
And marking Taniaâ€™s agitation,
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
And sulked in silent indignation;
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Avenge himself in proper style.
Triumphant by anticipation,
Caricatures he now designed
Of all the guests within his mind.

Certainly not Eugene alone
Tattianaâ€™s trouble might have spied,
But that the eyes of every one
By a rich pie were occupiedâ€”
Unhappily too salt by far;
And that a bottle sealed with tar
Appeared, Donâ€™s effervescing boast,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Behind, of glasses an array,
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
Made me so tipsy long ago!

From the moist cork the bottle freed
With loud explosion, the bright wine
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Long tortured by his lay divine,
Triquet arose, and for the bard
The company deep silence guard.
Tania well nigh expired when he
Turned to her and discordantly
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
Voices and hands applaud, and she
Must bow in common courtesy;
The poet, modest though so grand,
Drank to her health in the first place,
Then handed her the song with grace.

Congratulations, toasts resound,
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
But, when OnÃ©guineâ€™s turn came round,
The maidenâ€™s weary eye which yearned,
Her agitation and distress
Aroused in him some tenderness.
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
But somehow there shone in his look
The witching light of sympathy;
I know not if his heart felt pain
Or if he meant to flirt again,
From habit or maliciously,
But kindness from his eye had beamed
And to revive Tattiana seemed.

The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
As bees who leave their dainty store
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
Contented and with victuals stored,
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
And testy gamesters do engage
In boston and the game of age,
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
A strong resemblance these possessâ€”
All sons of mental weariness.

Eight rubbers were already played,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
Change of position had essayed,
When tea was brought. â€™Tis my delight
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
And supper. In the country we
Can count the time without much fussâ€”
The stomach doth admonish us.
And, by the way, I here assert
That for that matter in my verse
As many dinners I rehearse,
As oft to meat and drink advert,
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
Whom thirty centuries adore.

I will with thy divinity
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
But grant with magnanimity
Iâ€™m beaten in another matter;
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
More advantageously appear
Than cold OnÃ©guineâ€™s oddities,
The aspect of a landscape drear.
Or eâ€™en Istomina, my dear,
And fashionâ€™s gay frivolities;
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.

No one the contrary will urge,
Though for his Helen Menelaus
Again a century should scourge
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Though around honoured Priamâ€™s throne
Troyâ€™s sages should in concert own
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
Paris and Menelaus right.
But as to fightingâ€”â€™twill appear!
For patience, reader, I must plead!
A little farther please to read
And be not in advance severe.
Thereâ€™ll be a fight. I do not lie.
My word of honour given have I.

The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
But scarce had maids their saucers taâ€™en
When in the grand saloon was heard
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
His soul by crash of music fired,
His tea with rum no more desired,
The Paris of those country parts
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
A marriageable maid matured,
The poet from Tamboff secured,
BouyÃ noff whisked off Poustiakova.
All to the grand saloon are goneâ€”
The ball in all its splendour shone.

I tried when I began this tale,
(See the first canto if ye will),
A ball in Peterâ€™s capital,
To sketch ye in Albanoâ€™s style.
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
My memory wandered wide and sought
The feet of my dear lady friends.
O feet, whereâ€™er your path extends
I long enough deceived have erred.
The perfidies I recollect
Should make me much more circumspect,
Reform me both in deed and word,
And this fifth canto ought to be
From such digressions wholly free.

The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
Undeviating and insane
As giddy youthâ€™s hilarityâ€”
Pair after pair the race sustain.
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
Espying, Eugene with a smile
Approaches Olga and the pair
Amid the company career.
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
Begins to talk of this and that,
But when two minutes she had sat,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
All are amazed; but Lenski he
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.

Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
When the mazurka used to peal,
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
â€™Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
We glide along a floor of wax.
However, the mazurka lacks
Nought of its charms original
In country towns, where still it keeps
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
Fashion is there immutable,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
Of modern Russians the disease.

BouyÃ noff, wrathful cousin mine,
Unto the hero of this lay
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
OnÃ©guine Olga bore away.
Gliding in negligent career,
He bending whispered in her ear
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
And pressed her handâ€”the crimson blush
Upon her cheek by adulation
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
And hot with jealous indignation,
Till the mazurkaâ€™s close he stays,
Her hand for the cotillon prays.

She fears she cannot.â€”Cannot? Why?â€”
She promised Eugene, or she would
With great delight.â€”O God on high!
Heard he the truth? And thus she couldâ€”
And can it be? But late a child
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
Cunning already to display
And well-instructed to betray!
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Departed, ordered out his horse
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
A pair of bulletsâ€”nought besideâ€”
His fate shall presently decide.

Having remarked Vladimirâ€™s flight,
OnÃ©guine, bored to death again,
By Olga stood, dejected quite
And satisfied with vengeance taâ€™en.
Olga began to long likewise
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
And endless the cotillon seemed
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
â€™Tis done. To supper they proceed.
Bedding is laid out and to all
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Up to the attic, and all need
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
To pass the night at home hath gone.

All slumber. In the drawing-room
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
With better half as cumbersome;
Gvozdine, BouyÃ noff, PÃ©tÃ²ushkoff
And FliÃ noff, somewhat indisposed,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
In Olgaâ€™s and Tattianaâ€™s rooms
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
Except one by the window placed
Whom pale Dianaâ€™s ray illumesâ€”
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
But stares into the darkness deep.

His visit she had not awaited,
His momentary loving glance
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
And his strange conduct at the dance
With Olga; nor of this appeared
An explanation: she was scared,
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
A hand of ice appeared to seize
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
â€œI shall expire,â€ Tattiana cried,
â€œBut death from him will be delight.
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
He _cannot_ give me happiness.â€

Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
A new acquaintance we must scan.
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
Vladimirâ€™s property, a man
Who thrives this moment as I write,
A philosophic anchorite:
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
A gambling troop when he controlled,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Now of a family the head,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
How perfect doth our epoch grow!

Time was the flattering voice of fame,
His ruffian bravery adored,
And true, his pistolâ€™s faultless aim
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
But I must add to what I write
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
A valuable hostage gained,
A modern Regulus unchained,
Who to surrender did not blench
That every morn at Verreyâ€™s cost
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.

Time was, his raillery was gay,
He loved the simpleton to mock,
To make wise men the idiot play
Openly or â€™neath decent cloak.
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Encountered punishment complete,
And sometimes into snares as well
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
He could in disputation shine
With pungent or obtuse retort,
At times to silence would resort,
At times talk nonsense with design;
Quarrels among young friends he bred
And to the field of honour led;

Or reconciled them, it may be,
And all the three to breakfast went;
Then heâ€™d malign them secretly
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
(Like love, another sort of knavery!)
Diminishes as years decline.
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
From storms protection having sought,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
And lessons to his children read.

He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
To friendship making no pretence,
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Pervaded with much common sense.
He usually was glad to see
The man and liked his company,
So, when he came next day to call,
Was not surprised thereby at all.
But, after mutual compliments,
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Ere conversation could begin,
The epistle from the bard presents.
OnÃ©guine to the window went
And scanned in silence its content.

It was a cheery, generous
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Whereto in language courteous
Lenski his comrade did invite.
OnÃ©guine, by first impulse moved,
Turned and replied as it behoved,
Curtly announcing for the fray
That he was â€œready any day.â€
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
He cared no longer there to stay,
Had much to do at home that day,
And so departed. But Eugene,
The matter by his conscience tried,
Was with himself dissatisfied.

In fact, the subject analysed,
Within that secret court discussed,
In much his conduct stigmatized;
For, from the outset, â€™twas unjust
To jest as he had done last eve,
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
And ought he not to disregard
The poetâ€™s madness? for â€™tis hard
At eighteen not to play the fool!
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
Assuredly should not have been
Conventionalityâ€™s dull toolâ€”
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
But man of sense and probity.

He might his motives have narrated,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
He ought to have conciliated
That youthful heartâ€”â€œBut, now at least,
The opportunity is flown.
Besides, a duellist well-known
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Malicious and a slanderer.
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Should recompense his idle jeers,
But foolsâ€”their calumnies and sneersâ€â€”
Behold! the worldâ€™s opinion!
Our idol, Honourâ€™s motive force,
Round which revolves the universe.

Impatient, boiling oâ€™er with wrath,
The bard his answer waits at home,
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
Triumphant with the answer come.
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
He feared the criminal might try
To treat the matter as a jest,
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
From the dread pistol turn away.
But now all doubt was set aside,
Unto the windmill he must ride
To-morrow before break of day,
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.

Resolved the flirt to cast away,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
To see his Olga ere the frayâ€”
His watch, the sun in turn he viewsâ€”
Finally tost his arms in air
And lo! he is already there!
He deemed his coming would inspire
Olga with trepidation dire.
He was deceived. Just as before
The miserable bard to meet,
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
Olga ran skipping from the door.
She was as heedless and as gayâ€”
Well! just as she was yesterday.

â€œWhy did you leave last night so soon?â€
Was the first question Olga made,
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
All silently hung down his head.
Jealousy and vexation took
To flight before her radiant look,
Before such fond simplicity
And mental elasticity.
He eyed her with a fond concern,
Perceived that he was still beloved,
Already by repentance moved
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
But trembles, words he cannot find,
Delighted, almost sane in mind.

But once more pensive and distressed
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
To mention the foregoing eve,
He mused: â€œI will her saviour be!
With ardent sighs and flattery
The vile seducer shall not dare
The freshness of her heart impair,
Nor shall the caterpillar come
The lilyâ€™s stem to eat away,
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!â€â€”
All this, my friends, translate aright:
â€œI with my friend intend to fight!â€

If he had only known the wound
Which rankled in Tattianaâ€™s breast,
And if Tattiana mine had foundâ€”
If the poor maiden could have guessed
That the two friends with morningâ€™s light
Above the yawning grave would fight,â€”
Ah! it may be, affection true
Had reconciled the pair anew!
But of this love, eâ€™en casually,
As yet none had discovered aught;
Eugene of course related nought,
Tattiana suffered secretly;
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
Was famous for thick-headedness.

Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
To the pianoforte he moves
And various chords upon it proves,
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
â€œIâ€™m happy, say, is it not so?â€â€”
But it grew late; he must not stay;
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
To the young girl he said adieu,
As it were, tore himself away.
Gazing into his face, she said:
â€œWhat ails thee?â€â€”â€œNothing.â€â€”He is fled.

At home arriving he addressed
His care unto his pistolsâ€™ plight,
Replaced them in their box, undressed
And Schiller read by candlelight.
But one thought only filled his mind,
His mournful heart no peace could find,
Olga he sees before his eyes
Miraculously fair arise,
Vladimir closes up his book,
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
With loversâ€™ rubbish filled, was neat
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And spouted it with lyric fireâ€”
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.

Destiny hath preserved his lay.
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
â€œOh! whither have ye winged your way,
Ye golden days of my young spring?
What will the coming dawn reveal?
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
In mist profound all yet is hid.
So be it! Just the laws which bid
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Or innocently past me fly.
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
Of life or death predestinate.
Blest be the labours of the light,
And blest the shadows of the night.

â€œTo-morrowâ€™s dawn will glimmer gray,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
But the dark sepulchre I may
Have entered never to return.
The memory of the bard, a dream,
Will be absorbed by Letheâ€™s stream;
Men will forget me, but my urn
To visit, lovely maid, return,
Oâ€™er my remains to drop a tear,
And think: here lies who loved me well,
For consecrate to me he fell
In the dawn of existence drear.
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Approach, approach; I am thine own.â€

Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,
He wrote (â€™tis the romantic style,
Though of romance therein I fail
To see aughtâ€”never mind meanwhile)
And about dawn upon his breast
His weary head declined at rest,
For oâ€™er a word to fashion known,
â€œIdeal,â€ he had drowsy grown.
But scarce had sleepâ€™s soft witchery
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Into the chamber where he slept
And wakened him with the loud cry:
â€œâ€™Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
OnÃ©guine waits on us, â€™tis like.â€

He was in error; for Eugene
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
The pall of night was growing thin,
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
The sun had mounted high his steep,
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
Upon his couch insensibly;
Slumber still oâ€™er him lingering flies.
But finally he oped his eyes
And turned aside the drapery;
He gazed upon the clock which showed
He long should have been on the road.

He rings in haste; in haste arrives
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
And linen on him doth bestow.
Dressing as quickly as he can,
Eugene directs the trusty man
To accompany him and to escort
A box of terrible import.
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
He enters: to the mill he drives:
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
To bring behind: the triple steeds
To two young oaks the coachman leads.

Lenski the foemanâ€™s apparition
Leaning against the dam expects,
Zaretski, village mechanician,
In the meantime the mill inspects.
OnÃ©guine his excuses says;
â€œBut,â€ cried Zaretski in amaze,
â€œYour second you have left behind!â€
A duellist of classic mind,
Method was dear unto his heart
He would not that a man ye slay
In a lax or informal way,
But followed the strict rules of art,
And ancient usages observed
(For which our praise he hath deserved).

â€œMy second!â€ cried in turn Eugene,
â€œBehold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
To this arrangement can be seen,
No obstacle of which I know.
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
Heâ€™s a straightforward little chap.â€
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
â€œShall we commence?â€â€”â€œLet it be so,â€
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
In consultation stand asideâ€”
The foes with downcast eyes abide.

Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Asunder was and hate prepared?
Since leisure was together spent,
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Now, like hereditary foes,
Malignant fury they disclose,
As in some frenzied dream of fear
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
Mutual destruction to contrive.
Cannot they amicably smile
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Depart in peace and friendly live?
But fashionable hatredâ€™s flame
Trembles at artificial shame.

The shining pistols are uncased,
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
For the first time the hammer clicks.
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
The powder in the pan is laid,
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Measured with great exactitude.
At each extreme one takes his stand,
A loaded pistol in his hand.

â€œAdvance!â€â€” Indifferent and sedate,
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
With measured step and even gait
Athwart the snow four paces cameâ€”
Four deadly paces do they span;
OnÃ©guine slowly then began
To raise his pistol to his eye,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
And lo! five paces more they pass,
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
Took aimâ€”but as immediately
OnÃ©guine firedâ€”Alas! alas!
The poetâ€™s hour hath soundedâ€”See!
He drops his pistol silently.

He on his bosom gently placed
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
Not agony, but death expressed.
So from the mountain lazily
The avalanche of snow first bends,
Then glittering in the sun descends.
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
To the youth Eugene hurried nowâ€”
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
He was no more! The youthful bard
For evermore had disappeared.
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
Was withered ere the morning lightâ€”
The altar flame was quenched in night.

Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
His breast was riddled through and through,
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
Ere this but one brief moment beat
That heart with inspiration sweet
And enmity and hope and loveâ€”
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
Now, as in a deserted house,
All dark and silent hath become;
The inmate is for ever dumb,
The windows whitened, shutters closeâ€”
Whither departed is the host?
God knows! The very trace is lost.

â€™Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
With epigrams impertinent,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
His butting horns in anger bent,
The glass unwittingly inspect
And blush to own himself reflect.
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
Howl like a dolt: â€™tis meant for me!
But sweeter still it is to arrange
For him an honourable grave,
At his pale brow a shot to have,
Placed at the customary range;
But home his body to despatch
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.

Well, if your pistol ball by chance
The comrade of your youth should strike,
Who by a haughty word or glance
Or any trifle else ye like
You oâ€™er your wine insulted hathâ€”
Or even overcome by wrath
Scornfully challenged you afieldâ€”
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
Which in your spirit dominates,
When motionless your gaze beneath
He lies, upon his forehead death,
And slowly life coagulatesâ€”
When deaf and silent he doth lie
Heedless of your despairing cry?

Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
And with remorseful anguish filled,
Gazing on Lenskiâ€™s corse did standâ€”
Zaretski shouted: â€œWhy, heâ€™s killed!â€â€”
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
OnÃ©guine went with trepidation
And the attendants called in haste.
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
And hurried home his awful freight.
Conscious of death approximate,
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
His bit with foam besprinkled oâ€™er,
And homeward like an arrow tore.

My friends, the poet ye regret!
When hopeâ€™s delightful flower but bloomed
In bud of promise incomplete,
The manly toga scarce assumed,
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
And where the admirable streams
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Tender and elevated, free?
And where tempestuous loveâ€™s desires,
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
Imaginationâ€™s sacred fires,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?

Perchance to benefit mankind,
Or but for fame he saw the light;
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
Resounding through all ages might
Have echoed to eternity.
With worldly honours, it may be,
Fortune the poet had repaid.
It may be that his martyred shade
Carried a truth divine away;
That, for the century designed,
Had perished a creative mind,
And past the threshold of decay,
He neâ€™er shall hear Timeâ€™s eulogy,
The blessings of humanity.

Or, it may be, the bard had passed
A life in common with the rest;
Vanished his youthful years at last,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
In many things had changed his lifeâ€”
The Muse abandoned, taâ€™en a wife,
Inhabited the country, clad
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
A life of fact, not fiction, ledâ€”
At forty suffered from the gout,
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
And finally, upon his bed
Had finished life amid his sons,
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.

But, howsoeâ€™er his lot were cast,
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
Poetical enthusiast,
A friendly hand thy life hath taâ€™en!
There is a spot the village near
Where dwelt the Musesâ€™ worshipper,
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
A rivulet beneath them shoots
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
The reaping girls approach and ply
Within its wave the sounding pail,
And by that shady rivulet
A simple tombstone hath been set.

There, when the rains of spring we mark
Upon the meadows showering,
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
And the young damsel from the town,
For summer to the country flown,
Wheneâ€™er across the plain at speed
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
And reads with rapid eager eye
The simple epitaphâ€”a tear
Doth in her gentle eye appear.

And meditative from the spot
She leisurely away doth ride,
Spite of herself with Lenskiâ€™s lot
Longtime her mind is occupied.
She muses: â€œWhat was Olgaâ€™s fate?
Longtime was her heart desolate
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
And where may be her sister now?
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
Of fashionable dames the foe,
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
By whom the youthful bard was slain?â€â€”
In time Iâ€™ll give ye without fail
A true account and in detail.

But not at present, though sincerely
I on my chosen hero dote;
Though Iâ€™ll return to him right early,
Just at this moment I cannot.
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
And now, I mournfully confess,
In rhyming I show laziness.
As once, to fill the rapid page
My pen no longer finds delight,
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Sterner solicitudes engage,
In worldly din or solitude
Upon my visions such intrude.

Fresh aspirations I have known,
I am acquainted with fresh care,
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
Yet still remains the old despair.
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
And is it true her garland bright
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
And is it true and not a jest,
Not even a poetic phrase,
That vanished are my youthful days
(This joking I used to protest),
Never for me to reappearâ€”
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?

And so my noon hath come! If so,
I must resign myself, in sooth;
Yet let us part in friendship, O
My frivolous and jolly youth.
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
Loveâ€™s tender transports and distress,
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
And all that from thy hand proceedsâ€”
I thank thee. In thy company,
With tumult or contentment still
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
Commence a new career in life
And rest from bygone days of strife.

But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
Where my days in the wilderness
Of languor and of love did tell
And contemplative dreaminess;
And thou, youthâ€™s early inspiration,
Invigorate imagination
And spur my spiritâ€™s torpid mood!
Fly frequent to my solitude,
Let not the poetâ€™s spirit freeze,
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
Eventually petrify
In the worldâ€™s mortal revelries,
Amid the soulless sons of pride
And glittering simpletons beside;

Amid sly, pusillanimous
Spoiled children most degenerate
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
And stupid censors passionate;
Amid coquettes who pray to God
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
In haunts of fashion where each day
All with urbanity betray,
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
Amid the awful emptiness
Of conversation, thought and aimsâ€”
In that morass where you and I
Wallow, my friends, in company!

Impelled by Springâ€™s dissolving beams,
The snows from off the hills around
Descended swift in turbid streams
And flooded all the level ground.
A smile from slumbering nature clear
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
The woods, still naked to the view,
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
The bee forth from his cell of wax
Flew to collect his rural tax;
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
Herds low, and under nightâ€™s dark veil
Already sings the nightingale.

Mournful is thine approach to me,
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
What agitation languidly
My spirit and my blood doth move,
What sad emotions oâ€™er me steal
When first upon my cheek I feel
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Secure in rural quietudeâ€”
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Do all things which to mirth incline.
And make a dark existence shine
Inflict annoyance and distress
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?â€”
And is all light within destroyed?

Or, heedless of the leavesâ€™ return
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Do we alone our losses mourn
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
The coming of lifeâ€™s Autumn drear.
For which no springtime shall appear?
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
Wafted upon poetic wing,
Some other long-departed Spring,
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
With thoughts of a far distant land,
Of a strange night when the moon andâ€”

â€™Tis now the season! Idlers all,
Epicurean philosophers,
Ye men of fashion cynical,
Of Levshinâ€™s school ye followers,
Priams of country populations
And dames of fine organisations,
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
â€™Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
The time for mystic strolls which late
Into the starry night extend.
Quick to the country let us wend
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
In coach or post-cart duly placed
Beyond the city-barriers haste.

Thou also, reader generous,
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Abandon cities riotous,
Which in the winter were a joy:
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
Beside a nameless rivulet,
Where in the country Eugene yet,
An idle anchorite and sad,
A while ago the winter spent,
Near young Tattiana resident,
My pretty self-deceiving maidâ€”
No more the village knows his face,
For there he left a mournful trace.

Let us proceed unto a rill,
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
The river through the linden wood.
The nightingale there all night long,
Springâ€™s paramour, pours forth her song
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
And two old pines their branches spreadâ€”
â€œ_Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
Who early died a gallant death_,â€
Thereon the passing traveller read:
â€œ_The date, his fleeting years how longâ€”
Repose in peace, thou child of song_.â€

Time was, the breath of early dawn
Would agitate a mystic wreath
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
Above the humble urn of death.
Time was, two maidens from their home
At eventide would hither come,
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
But nowâ€”none heeds the monument
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
There is no wreath upon the bough:
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
As formerly the shepherd sits
And his poor basten sandal knits.

My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
Thee but a little space bewept,
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Another could her heart engage,
Another could her woe assuage
By flattery and loverâ€™s artâ€”
A lancer captivates her heart!
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
Mark ye with what a modest air
She bows her head beneath the crown;
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
Her lips where light smiles come and go!

My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
Passed into dull eternity,
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
Callous to all on earth becomeâ€”
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
The same unmoved oblivion
On us beyond the grave attends,
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
Whilst struggling for the heritage.

Soon Olgaâ€™s accents shrill resound
No longer through her former home;
The lancer, to his calling bound,
Back to his regiment must roam.
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
Distracted by her grief appears
When the hour came to bid good-byeâ€”
But my Tattianaâ€™s eyes were dry.
Only her countenance assumed
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
When all around the entrance pressed,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Around the carriage of the pairâ€”
Tattiana gently led them there.

And long her eyes as through a haze
After the wedded couple strain;
Alas! the friend of childish days
Away, Tattiana, hath been taâ€™en.
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
On whom a sisterâ€™s heart was set
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
For evermore is separate.
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
Into the tangled garden goes
But nowhere can she find repose,
Nor even tears afford respite,
Of consolation all bereftâ€”
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.

In cruel solitude each day
With flame more ardent passion burns,
And to OnÃ©guine far away
Her heart importunately turns.
She never more his face may view,
For was it not her duty to
Detest him for a brother slain?
The poet fell; already men
No more remembered him; unto
Another his betrothed was given;
The memory of the bard was driven
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
Two hearts perchance were desolate
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?

â€™Twas eve. â€™Twas dusk. The river speeds
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
Already dance to song proceeds;
The fisherâ€™s fire afar illumes
The riverâ€™s bank. Tattiana lone
Beneath the silver of the moon
Long time in meditation deep
Her path across the plain doth keepâ€”
Proceeds, until she from a hill
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
A village and beneath, a wood,
A garden by a shining rill.
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.

She hesitates, in doubt is thrownâ€”
â€œShall I proceed, or homeward flee?
He is not there: I am not known:
The house and garden I would see.â€
Tattiana from the hill descends
With bated breath, around she bends
A countenance perplexed and scared.
She enters a deserted yardâ€”
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
The household troop of little boys,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
The curs away to kennel chase,
The damsel under escort place.

â€œCan I inspect the mansion, please?â€
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
Unto Anicia for the keys
The family of children hie.
Anicia soon appears, the door
Opens unto her visitor.
Into the lonely house she went,
Wherein a space OnÃ©guine spent.
She gazedâ€”a cue, forgotten long,
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
A riding whip. She strolls along.
The beldam saith: â€œThe hearth, by it
The master always used to sit.

â€œDeparted Lenski here to dine
In winter time would often come.
Please follow this way, lady mine,
This is my masterâ€™s sitting-room.
â€™Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
Into accounts would sometimes look,
A book at early morn perused.
The room my former master used.
On Sundays by yon window he,
Spectacles upon nose, all day
Was wont with me at cards to play.
God save his soul eternally
And grant his weary bones their rest
Deep in our mother Earthâ€™s chill breast!â€

Tattianaâ€™s eyes with tender gleam
On everything around her gaze,
Of priceless value all things seem
And in her languid bosom raise
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
The table with its lamp unlit,
The pile of books, with carpet spread
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
The twilight pale which softens all,
Lord Byronâ€™s portrait on the wall
And the cast-iron statuette
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
Cocked hat and melancholy brow.

Long in this fashionable cell
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
Dark was the valley and the wood
Slept oâ€™er the river misty grown.
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
Long, long the hour had past when home
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
She hid the trouble of her breast,
Heaved an involuntary sigh
And turned to leave immediately,
But first permission did request
Thither in future to proceed
That certain volumes she might read.

Adieu she to the matron said
At the front gates, but in brief space
At early morn returns the maid
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
When in the studyâ€™s calm retreat,
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
She found herself alone at last,
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
But presently she tried to read;
At first for books was disinclined,
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
Remarkable. She then indeed
Devoured them with an eager zest.
A new world was made manifest!

Although we know that Eugene had
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Still certain authors, I may add,
He had excepted from the ban:
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
With it may be a couple more;
Romances three, in which ye scan
Portrayed contemporary man
As the reflection of his age,
His immorality of mind
To arid selfishness resigned,
A visionary personage
With his exasperated sense,
His energy and impotence.

And numerous pages had preserved
The sharp incisions of his nail,
And these the attentive maid observed
With eye precise and without fail.
Tattiana saw with trepidation
By what idea or observation
OnÃ©guine was the most impressed,
In what he merely acquiesced.
Upon those margins she perceived
OnÃ©guineâ€™s pencillings. His mind
Made revelations undesigned,
Of what he thought and what believed,
A dagger, asterisk, or note
Interrogation to denote.

And my Tattiana now began
To understand by slow degrees
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
Whom autocratic fateâ€™s decrees
Had bid her sigh for without hopeâ€”
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
Being from hell or heaven sent,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Which is he? or an imitation,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
A Russian in Childe Haroldâ€™s cloak,
Of foreign whims the impersonationâ€”
Handbook of fashionable phrase
Or parody of modern ways?

Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
But time flies and she doth forget
They long at home have her expectedâ€”
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
And a long time about her talked.
â€œWhat can be done? She is no child!â€
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
â€œOlinka is her junior, see.
â€™Tis time to marry her, â€™tis true,
But tell me what am I to do?
To all she answers cruellyâ€”
I will not wed, and ever weeps
And lonely through the forest creeps.â€

â€œIs she in love?â€ quoth one. â€œWith whom?
BouyÃ noff courted. She refused.
PÃ©tÃ²ushkoff met the selfsame doom.
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
How the young imp on Tania doted!
To captivate her how devoted!
I mused: perhaps the matterâ€™s squaredâ€”
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared.â€
â€œBut, _mÃ¡tushka_, to Moscow you
Should go, the market for a maid,
With many a vacancy, â€™tis said.â€â€”
â€œAlas! my friend, no revenue!â€
â€œEnough to see one winterâ€™s end;
If not, the money I will lend.â€

The venerable dame opined
The counsel good and full of reason,
Her money counted, and designed
To visit Moscow in the season.
Tattiana learns the intelligenceâ€”
Of her provincial innocence
The unaffected traits she now
Unto a carping world must showâ€”
Her toiletteâ€™s antiquated style,
Her antiquated mode of speech,
For Moscow fops and Circes each
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
Horror! had she not better stay
Deep in the greenwood far away?

Arising with the morningâ€™s light,
Unto the fields she makes her way,
And with emotional delight
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
â€œYe peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
The calm existence which I prize
I yield for splendid vanities,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Whither and wherefore do I speed
And what will Destiny concede?â€

Farther Tattianaâ€™s walks extendâ€”
â€™Tis now the hillock now the rill
Their natural attractions lend
To stay the maid against her will.
She the acquaintances she loves,
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Another visit hastes to pay.
But Summer swiftly fades away
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
A victim decked with golden leaves;
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
It blew: it howled: till winter eâ€™en
Came forth in all her magic sheen.

The snow descends and buries all,
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
A white and undulating pall
Oâ€™er hillock and oâ€™er meadow throws.
The channel of the river stilled
As if with eider-down is filled.
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
In mother Winterâ€™s strange caprice.
But Taniaâ€™s heart is not at ease,
Winterâ€™s approach she doth not hail
Nor the frost particles inhale
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Her shoulders, breast and face to laveâ€”
Alarm the winter journey gave.

The date was fixed though oft postponed,
But ultimately doth approach.
Examined, mended, newly found
Was the old and forgotten coach;
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
The household property contain:
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Basins and jugsâ€”well! everything
To happiness contributing.
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.

These to the coach of state are bound,
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Old women at the coachmen swear.
A bearded postillion astride
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
Unto the gates the servants fly
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
These take their seats; the coach of state
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
â€œAdieu! thou home where peace abides,
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
Shall I behold thee once again?â€â€”
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.

The limits of enlightenment
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
In course of time (the whole extent
Will not five centuries exceed
By computation) it is like
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
Highways all Russia will unite
And form a network left and right;
On iron bridges we shall gaze
Which oâ€™er the waters boldly leap,
Mountains weâ€™ll level and through deep
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
And Christian folk will, I expect,
An inn at every stage erect.

But now, what wretched roads one sees,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
And at the stages bugs and fleas
One momentâ€™s slumber suffer not.
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
And irritates the appetite.
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
Before a fire which feebly glows
Mends with the Russian hammerâ€™s blows
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
With blessings on the ditches and
The ruts of his own fatherland.

Yet on a frosty winter day
The journey in a sledge doth please,
No senseless fashionable lay
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
For our Automedons are fire
And our swift troikas never tire;
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
And like a palisade flit by.
The LÃ rinas unwisely went,
From apprehension of the cost,
By their own horses, not the postâ€”
So Tania to her heartâ€™s content
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.

But they draw near. Before them, lo!
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Whose countless golden crosses glow
As with innumerable fires.
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
When I yon semicircle bright
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Descried before me suddenly!
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
On thee I used to meditate!
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
For every loyal Russian breast!
How much is in that word expressed!

Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
His recent glory he invokes.
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Napoleon tarried till it please
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Time-honoured Kremlinâ€™s keys present.
Not so! My Moscow never went
To seek him out with bended head.
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
But lights incendiary flames
For the impatient chief instead.
From hence engrossed in thought profound
He on the conflagration frowned.

Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Appear; along the road of Tver
The coach is borne oâ€™er ruts and holes,
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Past palaces and nunneries,
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
And fashionable magazines,
Balconies, lionâ€™s heads on doors,
Jackdaws on every spireâ€”in scores.

The weary way still incomplete,
An hour passed byâ€”anotherâ€”till,
Near Kharitonâ€™s in a side street
The coach before a house stood still.
At an old auntâ€™s they had arrived
Who had for four long years survived
An invalid from lung complaint.
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
And spectacles, his knitting staid
And the saloon threw open wide;
The princess from the sofa cried
And the newcomers welcome bade.
The two old ladies then embraced
And exclamations interlaced.

â€œPrincesse, mon ange!â€â€”â€œPachette!â€â€”â€œAline!â€
â€œWho would have thought it? As of yore!
Is it for long?â€â€”â€œMa chÃ¨re cousine!â€
â€œSit down. How funny, to be sure!
â€™Tis a scene of romance, I vow!â€
â€œTania, my eldest child, you knowâ€â€”
â€œAh! come, Tattiana, come to me!
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Cousin, remembâ€™rest Grandison?â€
â€œWhat! Grandison?â€â€”â€œYes, certainly!â€
â€œOh! I remember, where is he?â€â€”
â€œHere, he resides with Simeon.
He called upon me Christmas Eveâ€”
His son is married, just conceive!â€

â€œAnd heâ€”but of him presentlyâ€”
To-morrow Tania we will show,
What say you? to the familyâ€”
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
See, I can hardly crawl aboutâ€”
But you must both be quite tired out!
Let us go seek a little restâ€”
Ah! Iâ€™m so weakâ€”my throbbing breast!
Oppressive now is happiness,
Not only sorrowâ€”Ah! my dear,
Now I am fit for nothing here.
In old age life is weariness!â€
Then weeping she sank back distressed
And fits of coughing racked her chest.

By the sick ladyâ€™s gaiety
And kindness Tania was impressed,
But, her own room in memory,
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Repose her silken curtains fled,
She could not sleep in her new bed.
The early tinkling of the bells
Which of approaching labour tells
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
The maiden at her casement sits
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
But ah! discerns nor wood nor meadâ€”
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.

To consanguineous dinners they
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
That grandmothers and grandsires may
Contemplate her sad reverie.
We Russians, friends from distant parts
Ever receive with kindly hearts
And exclamations and good cheer.
â€œHow Tania grows! Doth it appear
Long since I held thee at the fontâ€”
Since in these arms I thee did bearâ€”
And since I pulled thee by the earâ€”
And I to give thee cakes was wont?â€â€”
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
â€œOh! how our years are vanishing!â€

But nothing changed in them is seen,
All in the good old style appears,
Our dear old aunt, Princess HelÃ¨ne,
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
Ivan PetrÃ²vitch still a gaby,
Simeon PetrÃ²vitch just as shabby;
PÃ©lagie Nikolavna has
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
Still of his club he member wasâ€”
As deaf and silly doth remain,
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.

Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
In the beginning, cold and mute,
Moscowâ€™s young Graces at her stare,
Examine her from head to foot.
They deem her somewhat finical,
Outlandish and provincial,
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
Obedient then to Natureâ€™s law,
With her they did associate,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
And oft in whispers would impart
A maidenâ€™s secretsâ€”of the heart.

Triumphsâ€”their own or those of friendsâ€”
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
Their harmless conversation blends
With scandalâ€™s trivial ornament.
Then to reward such confidence
Her amorous experience
With mute appeal to ask they seemâ€”
But Tania just as in a dream
Without participation hears,
Their voices nought to her impart
And the lone secret of her heart,
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
She buries deep within her breast
Nor aught confides unto the rest.

Tattiana would have gladly heard
The converse of the world polite,
But in the drawing-room all appeared
To find in gossip such delight,
Speech was so tame and colourless
Their slander eâ€™en was weariness;
In their sterility of prattle,
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
No sense was ever manifest
Though by an error and unsoughtâ€”
The languid mind could smile at nought,
Heart would not throb albeit in jestâ€”
Even amusing fools we miss
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.

In groups, official striplings glance
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
And views amongst themselves advance
Unfavourable unto her.
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
And leaning â€™gainst the portal closed
To her an elegy composed.
Also one ViÃ¡zemski, remarking
Tattiana by a poor auntâ€™s side,
Successfully to please her tried,
And an old gent the poet marking
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
To ask her name the trouble took.

But where Melpomene doth rave
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
And her bespangled robe doth wave
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
And where Thalia softly dreams
And heedless of approval seems,
Terpsichore alone among
Her sisterhood delights the young
(So â€™twas with us in former years,
In your young days and also mine),
Never upon my heroine
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
The connoisseur his glances throws
From boxes or from stalls in rows.

To the assembly her they bear.
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
The crash of music, candlesâ€™ glare
And rapid whirl of many feet,
The ladiesâ€™ dresses airy, light,
The motley moving mass and bright,
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
To strike imagination serve.
â€™Tis there that arrant fops display
Their insolence and waistcoats white
And glasses unemployed all night;
Thither hussars on leave will stray
To clank the spur, delight the fairâ€”
And vanish like a bird in air.

Full many a lovely star hath night
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
Yet clearer shines than every light
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
Shines in the female firmament
Like a full moon magnificent.
Lo! with what pride celestial
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Her heart how full of gentleness,
Her glance how wild yet genial!
Enough, enough, conclude thy layâ€”
For follyâ€™s dues thou hadst to pay.

Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
Gallop, mazurka, waltzingâ€”see!
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
Tania, observed by nobody,
Looks upon all with absent gaze
And hates the worldâ€™s discordant ways.
â€™Tis noisome to her there: in thought
Again her rural life she sought,
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
The little solitary nook
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
And the lime alleyâ€™s twilight dim
Where the first time she met with _him_.

Thus widely meditation erred,
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
Whilst from her countenance neâ€™er stirred
The eyes of a grave general.
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Each gave Tattianaâ€™s arm a nudge
And in a whisper did repeat:
â€œLook quickly to your left, my sweet!â€
â€œThe left? Why, what on earth is there?â€â€”
â€œNo matter, look immediately.
There, in that knot of company,
Two dressed in uniform appearâ€”
Ah! he has gone the other wayâ€â€”
â€œWho? Is it that stout general, pray?â€â€”

Let us congratulations pay
To our Tattiana conquering,
And for a time our course delay,
That I forget not whom I sing.
Let me explain that in my song
â€œI celebrate a comrade young
And the extent of his caprice;
O epic Muse, my powers increase
And grant success to labour long;
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Grant that I err not on the road.â€
Enough! my pack is now unslungâ€”
To classicism Iâ€™ve homage paid,
Though late, have a beginning made.

In the Lyceumâ€™s noiseless shade
As in a garden when I grew,
I Apuleius gladly read
But would not look at Cicero.
â€™Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
In spring-time, heard the cygnetâ€™s note
By waters shining tranquilly,
That first the Muse appeared to me.
Into the study of the boy
There came a sudden flash of light,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Sang childhoodâ€™s pastimes and its joy,
Glory with which our history teems
And the heartâ€™s agitated dreams.

And the world met her smilingly,
A first success light pinions gave,
The old Derjavine noticed me,
And blest me, sinking to the grave.
Then my companions young with pleasure
In the unfettered hours of leisure
Her utterances ever heard,
And by a partial temper stirred
And boiling oâ€™er with friendly heat,
They first of all my brow did wreathe
And an encouragement did breathe
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
O triumphs of my guileless days,
How sweet a dream your memories raise!

Passionâ€™s wild sway I then allowed,
Her promptings unto law did make,
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
My sportive Muse I used to take
To many a noisy feast and fight,
Terror of guardians of the night;
And wild festivities among
She brought with her the gift of song.
Like a Bacchante in her sport
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
And the young revellers of past times
Vociferously paid her court,
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
Of my light paramour was proud.

But I abandoned their array,
And fled afarâ€”she followed me.
How oft the kindly Muse away
Hath whiled the roadâ€™s monotony,
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
Like Leonora did she ride
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
How oft to the Crimean shore
She led me through nocturnal mist
Unto the sounding sea to list,
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
And where the billows hoarsely raise
To God eternal hymns of praise.

Then, the far capital forgot,
Its splendour and its blandishments,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
She visited the humble tents
Of migratory gipsy hordesâ€”
And wild among them grew her wordsâ€”
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
But suddenly all changed around!
Lo! in my garden was she found
And as a country damsel roved,
A pensive sorrow in her glance
And in her hand a French romance.

Now for the first time I my Muse
Lead into good society,
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
With jealous fear, anxiety.
Through dense aristocratic rows
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
And supercilious dames she glides,
Sits down and gazes on all sidesâ€”
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Variety of speech and vests,
Deliberate approach of guests
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.

Assemblies oligarchical
Please her by their decorum fixed,
The rigour of cold pride and all
Titles and ages intermixed.
But who in that choice company
With clouded brow stands silently?
Unknown to all he doth appear,
A vision desolate and drear
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
Pray is it he? It is the same.
â€œAnd is it long since back he came?

â€œIs he the same or grown more wise?
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
He has returned, say in what guise?
What is his latest character?
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
Philanthropist or patriot,
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Like you and me and all the rest?â€”
But this is my advice, â€™twere best
Not to behave as he did onceâ€”
Society he duped enow.â€
â€œIs he known to you?â€â€”â€œYes and No.â€

Wherefore regarding him express
Perverse, unfavourable views?
Is it that human restlessness
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
Is it that ardent souls of flame
By recklessness amuse or shame
Selfish nonentities around?
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
And that too often we receive
Professions eagerly for deeds,
That crass stupidity misleads,
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
That mediocrity alone
Without disgust we look upon?

Happy he who in youth was young,
Happy who timely grew mature,
He who lifeâ€™s frosts which early wrung
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
By visions who was neâ€™er deranged
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
At twenty who was prig or swell,
At thirty who was married well,
At fifty who relief obtained
From public and from private ties,
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
And unto whom we all allude
As to a worthy man and good!

But sad is the reflection made,
In vain was youth by us received,
That we her constantly betrayed
And she at last hath us deceived;
That our desires which noblest seemed,
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
Have one by one all withered grown
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strownâ€”
â€™Tis fearful to anticipate
Nought but of dinners a long row,
To look on life as on a show,
Eternally to imitate
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
Its passions and its modes of thought.

The butt of scandal having been,
â€™Tis dreadfulâ€”ye agree, I hopeâ€”
To pass with reasonable men
For a fictitious misanthrope,
A visionary mortified,
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Or eâ€™en the â€œDemonâ€ of my strain.
OnÃ©guineâ€”take him up againâ€”
In duel having killed his friend
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
Wearied of leisure in the end,
Without profession, business, wife,
He knew not how to spend his life.

Him a disquietude did seize,
A wish from place to place to roam,
A very troublesome disease,
In some a willing martyrdom.
Abandoned he his country seat,
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
Where every day before his eyes
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
And aimless journeys did commenceâ€”
But still remembrance to him clings,
His travels like all other things
Inspired but weariness intense;
Returning, from his ship amid
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.

Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
A whisper runs along the hall,
A lady draws the hostess near,
Behind her a grave general.
Her manners were deliberate,
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
There was no angling for success.
Her features no grimaces bleared;
Of affectation innocent,
Calm and without embarrassment,
A faithful model she appeared
Of â€œcomme il faut.â€ ShishkÃ²ff, forgive!
I canâ€™t translate the adjective.

Ladies in crowds around her close,
Her with a smile old women greet,
The men salute with lower bows
And watch her eyeâ€™s full glance to meet.
Maidens before her meekly move
Along the hall, and high above
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
The general who accompanies.
None could her beautiful declare,
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
None could a trace of that impute,
Which in the elevated sphere
Of London life is â€œvulgarâ€ called
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.

I like this word exceedingly
Although it will not bear translation,
With us â€™tis quite a novelty
Not high in general estimation;
â€™Twould serve ye in an epigramâ€”
But turn we once more to our dame.
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
At table she was sitting by
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
The Nevaâ€™s Cleopatra, and
None the conviction could withstand
That Ninaâ€™s marble symmetry,
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
Could not eclipse her neighbourâ€™s light.

â€œAnd is it,â€ meditates Eugene.
â€œAnd is it she? It must beâ€”noâ€”
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,â€â€”
And the eternal lorgnette through
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Seek the forgotten countenance
Familiar to him long ago.
â€œInform me, prince, pray dost thou know
The lady in the crimson cap
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?â€â€”
The princeâ€™s eye OnÃ©guine seeks:
â€œAh! long the world hath missed thy shape!
But stop! I will present thee, if
You choose.â€â€”â€œBut who is she?â€â€”â€œMy wife.â€

â€œSo thou art wed! I did not know.
Long ago?â€â€”â€œâ€™Tis the second year.â€
â€œToâ€”?â€â€”â€œLÃ rina.â€â€”â€œTattiana?â€â€”â€œSo.
And dost thou know her?â€â€”â€œWe live near.â€
â€œThen come with me.â€ The prince proceeds,
His wife approaches, with him leads
His relative and friend as well.
The ladyâ€™s glance upon him fellâ€”
And though her soul might be confused,
And vehemently though amazed
She on the apparition gazed,
No signs of trouble her accused,
A mien unaltered she preserved,
Her bow was easy, unreserved.

Ah no! no faintness her attacked
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Her brow she did not eâ€™en contract
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Not the least trace OnÃ©guine sees
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
He conversation would have ledâ€”
But could not. Then she questioned him:â€”
â€œHad he been long here, and where from?
Straight from their province had he come?â€â€”
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
Unto her husband, went awayâ€”
Transfixed OnÃ©guine mine doth stay.

Is this the same Tattiana, say,
Before whom once in solitude,
In the beginning of this lay,
Deep in the distant province rude,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
He salutary rules poured forth?
The maid whose note he still possessed
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
Where all upon the surface lies,â€”
That girlâ€”but he must dreaming beâ€”
That girl whom once on a time he
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Can she have been a moment gone
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?

He quits the fashionable throng
And meditative homeward goes,
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
Do agitate his late repose.
He wakesâ€”they with a letter comeâ€”
The Princess N. will be at home
On such a day. O Heavens, â€™tis she!
Oh! I accept. And instantly
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
In the recesses what hath stirred
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
Again the plague of boyhoodâ€”love?

The hours once more OnÃ©guine counts,
Impatient waits the close of day,
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
And gallops to her house away.
Trembling he seeks the young princessâ€”
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
Together moments one or two
They sat, but conversationâ€™s flow
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Scarce to her questions he responds,
Full of exasperating thought.
He fixedly upon her staresâ€”
She calm and unconcerned appears.

The husband comes and interferes
With this unpleasant _tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte_,
With Eugene pranks of former years
And jests doth recapitulate.
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
The conversation was revived
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
But round the hostess scintillate
Light sallies without coxcombry,
Awhile sound conversation seems
To banish far unworthy themes
And platitudes and pedantry,
And never was the ear affright
By liberties or loose or light.

And yet the cityâ€™s flower was there,
Noblesse and models of the mode,
Faces which we meet everywhere
And necessary fools allowed.
Behold the dames who once were fine
With roses, caps and looks malign;
Some marriageable maids behold,
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Economy political,
And with gray hair ambrosial
The old man who has had his freaks,
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
But now ridiculous a bit.

Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
Saint Priest, who every albumâ€™s page
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
Another tribune of the ball
Hung like a print against the wall,
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
The traveller, bird of passage he,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Awakens secret merriment
By his embarrassed dignityâ€”
Mute glances interchanged aside
Meet punishment for him provide.

But my OnÃ©guine the whole eve
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
Not the young timid maid, believe,
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
But the indifferent princess,
Divinity without access
Of the imperial Nevaâ€™s shore.
O Men, how very like ye are
To Eve the universal mother,
Possession hath no power to please,
The serpent to unlawful trees
Aye bids ye in some way or otherâ€”
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Our paradise is no more sweet.

Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
How thoroughly her part she took!
How soon to habits she conformed
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Who would the maiden innocent
In the unmoved, magnificent
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
And he had made her heart beat quick!
â€™Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
She mourned and to the moon would raise
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
To end with him her path below.

To Love all ages lowly bend,
But the young unpolluted heart
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
Youth freshens beneath Passionâ€™s showers,
Develops and matures its powers,
And thus in season the rich field
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
But at a later, sterile age,
The solstice of our earthly years,
Mournful Loveâ€™s deadly trace appears
As storms which in chill autumn rage
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And devastate the woods around.

There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Both day and night he now must pass
In love-lorn meditation sad.
Careless of every social rule,
The crystals of her vestibule
He daily in his drives drew near
And like a shadow haunted her.
Enraptured was he if allowed
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.

She seemed of him oblivious,
Despite the anguish of his breast,
Received him freely at her house,
At times three words to him addressed
In company, or simply bowed,
Or recognized not in the crowd.
No coquetry was there, I vouchâ€”
Society endures not such!
OnÃ©guineâ€™s cheek grew ashy pale,
Either she saw not or ignored;
OnÃ©guine wasted; on my word,
Already he grew phthisical.
All to the doctors Eugene send,
And they the waters recommend.

He went notâ€”sooner was prepared
To write his forefathers to warn
Of his approach; but nothing cared
Tattianaâ€”thus the sex is born.â€”
He obstinately will remain,
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
Sickness more courage doth command
Than health, so with a trembling hand
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
Though correspondence as a rule
He used to hateâ€”and was no foolâ€”
Yet suffering emotional
Had rendered him an invalid;
But word for word his letter read.

No answer! He another sent.
Epistle second, note the third,
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
To an assemblyâ€”she appeared
Just as he entered. How severe!
She will not see, she will not hear.
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
The indignation of her heart!
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Upon her brow sits wrath aloneâ€”

And it may be a secret dread
Lest the world or her lord divine
A certain little escapade
Well known unto OnÃ©guine mine.
â€™Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
Cursing his own stupidity,
And brooding oâ€™er the ills he bore,
Society renounced once more.
Then in the silent cabinet
He in imagination saw
The time when Melancholyâ€™s claw
â€™Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
Caught him and by the collar took
And shut him in a lonely nook.

He read as vainly as before,
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Some Russian authors he perusedâ€”
Nought in the universe refused:
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Which lessons unto us repeat,
Wherein I castigation get;
And where a madrigal occurs
Writ in my honour now and thenâ€”
_E sempre bene_, gentlemen!

But what results? His eyes peruse
But thoughts meander far awayâ€”
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
His intellect in close array.
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
On lines invisible are fixt;
â€™Twas these he read and these alone
His spirit was intent upon.
They were the wonderful traditions
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
Dreams with no continuity,
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
The lively trash of stories long
Or letters of a maiden young.

And by degrees upon him grew
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
And soon imagination threw
Before him her wild game of chance.
And now upon the snow in thaw
A young man motionless he saw,
As one who bivouacs afield,
And heard a voice cryâ€”_Why! Heâ€™s killed!_â€”
And now he views forgotten foes,
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
A mansionâ€”by the window, see!
She sits aloneâ€”â€™tis ever _she!_

So frequently his mind would stray
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
Almost became a poet sayâ€”
Oh! what had been his eminence!
Indeed, by force of magnetism
A Russian poemâ€™s mechanism
My scholar without aptitude
At this time almost understood.
How like a poet was my chum
When, sitting by his fire alone
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
He â€œBenedettaâ€ used to hum,
Or â€œIdol mio,â€ and in the grate
Would lose his slippers or gazette.

Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Winter resigned her empire white,
OnÃ©guine neâ€™er as poet showed
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
His chambers close wherein confined
He marmot-like did hibernate,
His double sashes and his grate,
And sallied forth one brilliant mornâ€”
Along the Nevaâ€™s bank he sleighs,
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
The snow upon the streets doth meltâ€”
Whither along them doth he pelt?

OnÃ©guine whither gallops? Ye
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
Unto his own Tattiana he,
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
The vestibule finds empty quiteâ€”
He enters the saloon. â€™Tis blank!
A door he opens. But why shrank
He back as from a sudden blow?â€”
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Gazing upon a note below.
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.

Oh! who her speechless agonies
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Who now could fail to recognize
Tattiana in the young princess!
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
Eugene fell prostrate at her feetâ€”
She starts, nor doth a word express,
But gazes on OnÃ©guineâ€™s face
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
Imploring looks and mute complaint
She comprehends. The simple maid
By fond illusions once possest
Is once again made manifest.

His kneeling posture he retainsâ€”
Calmly her eyes encounter hisâ€”
Insensible her hand remains
Beneath his lipsâ€™ devouring kiss.
What visions then her fancy throngedâ€”
A breathless silence then, prolongedâ€”
But finally she softly said:
â€œEnough, arise! for much we need
Without disguise ourselves explain.
OnÃ©guine, hast forgotten yet
The hour whenâ€”Fate so willedâ€”we met
In the lone garden and the lane?
How meekly then I heard you preachâ€”
To-day it is my turn to teach.

â€œOnÃ©guine, I was younger then,
And better, if I judge aright;
I loved youâ€”what did I obtain?
Affection how did you requite?
But with austerity!â€”for you
No noveltyâ€”is it not true?â€”
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
But nowâ€”my very blood congeals,
Calling to mind your icy look
And sermonâ€”but in that dread hour
I blame not your behaviourâ€”
An honourable course ye took,
Displayed a noble rectitudeâ€”
My soul is filled with gratitude!

â€œThen, in the country, isâ€™t not true?
And far removed from rumour vain;
I did not please you. Why pursue
Me now, inflict upon me pain?â€”
Wherefore am I your quarry held?â€”
Is it that I am now compelled
To move in fashionable life,
That I am rich, a princeâ€™s wife?â€”
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
Is petted by the Emperor?â€”
That my dishonour would ensure
A notoriety proclaimed,
And in society might shed
A bastard fame prohibited?

â€œI weep. And if within your breast
My image hath not disappeared,
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Your conversation cold and hard,
If the choice in my power were,
To lawless love I should preferâ€”
And to these letters and these tears.
For visions of my childish years
Then ye were barely generous,
Age immature averse to cheatâ€”
But nowâ€”what brings you to my feet?â€”
How mean, how pusillanimous!
A prudent man like you and brave
To shallow sentiment a slave!

â€œOnÃ©guine, all this sumptuousness,
The gilding of lifeâ€™s vanities,
In the worldâ€™s vortex my success,
My splendid house and gaietiesâ€”
What are they? Gladly would I yield
This life in masquerade concealed,
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
For my wild garden and bookcase,â€”
Yes! for our unpretending home,
OnÃ©guineâ€”the beloved place
Where the first time I saw your face,â€”
Or for the solitary tomb
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.

â€œâ€™Twas possible then, happinessâ€”
Nay, nearâ€”but destiny decreedâ€”
My lot is fixedâ€”with thoughtlessness
It may be that I did proceedâ€”
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
Indifferent was her future fate.
I marriedâ€”now, I supplicateâ€”
For ever your Tattiana leave.
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Honour and pride inflexible.
I love youâ€”to what end deceive?â€”
But I am now anotherâ€™s brideâ€”
For ever faithful will abide.â€

She roseâ€”departed. But Eugene
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
What a storm of emotions keen
Raged round him and of balked desire!
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
And Taniaâ€™s husband soon appeared.â€”
But now our hero we must leave
Just at a moment which I grieve
Must be pronounced unfortunateâ€”
For longâ€”for ever. To be sure
Together we have wandered oâ€™er
The world enough. Congratulate
Each other as the shore we climb!
Hurrah! it long ago was time!

Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
To part in amity with thee!
Adieu! whateâ€™er thou didst desire
From careless stanzas such as these,
Of passion reminiscences,
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Repose from labour, satire keen,
Or faults of grammar on its pageâ€”
God grant that all who herein glance,
In serious mood or dalliance
Or in a squabble to engage,
May find a crumb to satisfy.
Now we must separate. Good-bye!

And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
Thou also, my ideal true,
And thou, persistent to the end,
My little book. With thee I knew
All that a poet could desire,
Oblivion of lifeâ€™s tempest dire,
Of friends the grateful intercourseâ€”
Oh, many a year hath run its course
Since I beheld Eugene and young
Tattiana in a misty dream,
And my romanceâ€™s open theme
Glittered in a perspective long,
And I discerned through Fancyâ€™s prism
Distinctly not its mechanism.

But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
As Saadi anciently averredâ€”
Some are afar and some are dead.
Without them Eugene is complete;
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
Was drawn, ideal of my layâ€”
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
Happy who quit lifeâ€™s banquet seat
Before the dregs they shall divine
Of the cup brimming oâ€™er with wineâ€”
Who the romance do not complete,
But who abandon itâ€”as I
Have my OnÃ©guineâ€”suddenly.
